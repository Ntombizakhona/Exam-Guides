# AI Practitioner Exam Guide

...like the Cloud Practitioner Exam opened our eyes to the potential of the cloud, the **AWS Certified AI Practitioner (AIF-C01)** is designed to provide that same foundational _common language_ for the world of Artificial Intelligence.

Whether you’re an Executive, Developer, Engineer, or Project Manager, having a baseline understanding of AI principles is no longer a _nice to have_, it’s **absolutely essential.**

## 📘 What the AWS Certified AI Practitioner Exam Covers

According to AWS, the **AWS Certified AI Practitioner (AIF-C01)** is intended for individuals who can effectively demonstrate an overall knowledge of AI/ML, Generative AI Technologies, and associated AWS services, independent of a specific technical job role.

It isn't about proving you can build complex neural networks from scratch. Instead, it validates your ability to:

*   **Understand Concepts:** Grasp AI, ML, and generative AI methods both generally and specifically on AWS.
*   **Ask the Right Questions:** Determine the appropriate use of AI/ML technologies within your organization.
*   **Apply the Right Tools:** Identify which AI/ML technologies fit specific business use cases.
*   **Operate Responsibly:** Use AI technologies ethically and within security guidelines.

---

### 🎯 Who is the target candidate?
The ideal candidate has up to **6 months of exposure** to AI/ML on AWS. Importantly, you are expected to be a **user** of AI solutions, not necessarily a builder of models.

### 🚫 What is out of scope?
To keep this accessible, the following tasks are **not** required for this exam:
*   Developing or coding AI/ML models/algorithms.
*   Performing hyperparameter tuning or model optimization.
*   Building and deploying full ML pipelines.
*   Conducting deep mathematical or statistical analysis.


## 🧭 Exam Domains and Weighting

The exam is divided into five main content domains. While Generative AI is the "star of the show," the exam ensures you have a grounded understanding of traditional ML and security as well.

| Domain | Description | Weight |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Domain 1: Fundamentals of AI and ML** | Basic concepts, types of ML, and the ML lifecycle. | 20% |
| **Domain 2: Fundamentals of Generative AI** | What GenAI is, how Foundation Models work, and terminology like "tokens." | 24% |
| **Domain 3: Applications of FMs** | How to actually use Foundation Models (Bedrock, SageMaker) for real tasks. | 28% |
| **Domain 4: Guidelines for Responsible AI** | Fairness, bias, explainability, and safety. | 14% |
| **Domain 5: Security & Governance** | Compliance, IAM, and the Shared Responsibility Model for AI. | 14% |
