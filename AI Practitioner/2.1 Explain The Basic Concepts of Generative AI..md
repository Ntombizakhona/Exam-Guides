# Explain The Basic Concepts of Generative AI.

🤖 **Exam Guide:** AI Practitioner
**Domain 2: Fundamentals of Generative AI**
📘_Task Statement 2.1_


**Domain 1** gives you the language of **AI and ML**. 
**Domain 2** shifts the focus to something more specific and increasingly central in AWS exam content and real-world workloads: **Generative AI**.

Instead of predicting a label us fraud/not fraud or a number such as next month’s demand...GenAI models *generate* new content: text, images, audio, video, and code based on patterns learned from massive datasets. 

This domain is about understanding the core building blocks (tokens, embeddings, transformers, diffusion), common use cases, and the high-level lifecycle of foundation models.

## 🎯 Objectives
The objective of Task 2.1 is to define the core concepts and terminology of generative AI, recognize common real-world use cases for generative AI models, and describe the foundation model lifecycle from data and model selection through pre-training, fine-tuning, evaluation, deployment, and feedback.

### 1) Define foundational GenAI concepts

#### 1.1 **Tokens**
**Tokens** are the basic units a language model reads and writes.
A token might be a word, part of a word, punctuation, or whitespace.
**Why Tokens Matter:** _cost/latency and model limits are often tied to token counts (input + output)._

#### 1.2 **Chunking**
**Chunking** is splitting large text into smaller segments _(“chunks”)_ so it can be processed effectively.
Chunking is commonly used in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): store/search chunks, then provide the most relevant chunks to the model.
**Why Chunking Matters:** _models have **context window** limits therefore chunking helps you fit useful information into the prompt._

#### 1.3 **Embeddings**
**Embeddings** are numeric representations of content (text/images/etc.) that capture meaning.
Similar items end up with similar embeddings.
**Embeddings Are Used For:** 

1. semantic search
2. clustering
3. recommendation
4. retrieval.

#### 1.4 **Vectors**
A **vector** is the array of numbers that represents an embedding.
You compare vectors with similarity metrics (e.g., cosine similarity) to find _“closest meaning.”_

#### 1.5 **Prompt Engineering**
**Prompt Engineering** is crafting instructions and context to guide model outputs.
**Prompt Engineering Techniques Include**: 

1. clear instructions 
2. role prompting 
3. examples (few-shot)
4. constraints
5. formatting requirements 
6. and grounding with retrieved context

_Effective Prompt Engineering Techniques matter because they can dramatically improve quality without retraining._

#### 1.6  **Transformer-based LLMs**
Many modern LLMs are based on the **transformer** architecture.
The key idea in transformer based LLMs are the attention mechanisms that help the model focus on relevant parts of the input.
**Strengths of Transformers:**

1. language understanding/generation
2. summarization
3. extraction
4. _reasoning-like_ behavior (with limitations)

#### 1.7  **Foundation Models (FMs)**
**Foundation models** are large, general-purpose models trained on broad datasets and adaptable to many tasks.
LLMs are a common type of foundation model, but FMs can also be for images, audio, or multimodal tasks.

#### 1.8 **Multimodal Models**
**Multimodal** models can accept and/or generate more than one modality (e.g., text + image).
**Example:** provide an image and ask for a description, or provide text and generate an image.

#### 1.9 Diffusion models
**Diffusion models** are commonly used for image generation.
They learn to reverse a “noising” process: starting from noise and iteratively producing an image.
**Why Diffusion Models Matter:** diffusion is a major approach behind high-quality text-to-image generation.

### 2) Identify Potential Use Cases for GenAI Models

GenAI is useful when you want to **generate, transform, or interact with content** at scale.

Common Real-world use cases include:

#### 2.1 **Summarization**

1. Meeting notes
2. incident reports
3. legal docs 
4. support tickets
5. medical notes (with governance)

#### 2.2 **AI Assistants And Chatbots**

1. Employee helpdesk
2. IT ops assistant
3. knowledge-base Q&A
4. HR policy assistant

#### 2.3 **Translation**

1. Multilingual customer support 
2. global documentation
3. localization pipelines

#### 2.4 **Code Generation**

1. Boilerplate generation 
2. code explanation
3. test generation
4. refactoring assistance

#### 2.5 **Customer service agents**

1. Draft responses 
2. classify intents
3. suggest resolutions
4. automate routine interactions

#### 2.6 **Search (Semantic Search)**
Search by meaning, not just keywords (often powered by embeddings + retrieval)

#### 2.7 **Recommendation engines**
Use embeddings and generative reasoning to propose relevant products/content

#### 2.8 **Image, Video, and Audio Generation**

1. Marketing creatives 
2. product mockups 
3. voiceovers
4. prototyping,
5. content creation workflows

_GenAI is especially strong when tasks involve language/content generation or understanding unstructured data, not when you need guaranteed deterministic outputs._

### 3) Describe The Foundation Model Lifecycle
Foundation models follow a lifecycle similar in spirit to ML, but with GenAI-specific steps and decisions:

#### 3.1 **Data selection**
Choose large, diverse datasets (text, images, code, etc.), applying filtering and quality controls.
_Includes handling sensitive data, licensing, and safety considerations._

#### 3.2 **Model selection**
Choose an existing FM or decide to pre-train/customize based on needs:

1.      capability requirements (quality, reasoning, multimodal)
2.      latency/cost constraints
3.      domain specificity
4.      governance requirements

#### 3.3 **Pre-training**
Train the foundation model on massive corpora to learn general representations.
_This is expensive and typically done by large providers._

#### 3.4 **Fine-tuning**
Adapt the model to a specific domain/task using additional data (often smaller and higher quality).
_Can improve tone, format, domain knowledge, and task performance._

#### 3.5 **Evaluation**
Evaluate quality, safety, and performance:

1.      task quality (helpfulness, correctness)
2.      robustness (edge cases)
3.      bias/fairness
4.      toxicity/safety
5.      hallucination tendencies (as applicable)

#### 3.6 **Deployment**
Serve the model for real-time or batch use.
_Requires decisions on scaling, latency, cost controls, and access management._

#### 3.7 **Feedback**
Collect user feedback and operational signals (e.g., thumbs up/down, corrections, failure reports).
_Use feedback to improve prompts, retrieval data, guardrails, or to trigger fine-tuning/retraining._

Key Idea: _In production, GenAI improvement is often iterative via **prompting + retrieval + feedback**, not just “train once and forget.”_

### ✅ _Answers to Quick Questions_

**1.** A **token** is a unit of text the model processes (word, subword, punctuation, etc.). Token count matters because it affects **context limits** (how much the model can read at once), **latency**, and often **cost** (pricing commonly depends on input/output tokens).

**2.** **Chunking** is splitting large text into smaller pieces so it can be searched or fit into a model’s context window. It’s commonly used in **RAG** workflows (store chunks, retrieve the most relevant ones, then add them to the prompt).

**3.** **Embeddings** are numeric representations of content; the embedding is stored as a **vector**. They’re commonly used for **semantic similarity** tasks such as semantic search, retrieval, clustering, and recommendations.

**4.** Prompt engineering aims to improve the model’s **output quality and reliability** by giving clearer instructions and context. One technique is **few-shot prompting** (providing a couple of examples of the desired input/output format).

**5.** **Pre-training** teaches a model broad, general capabilities from massive datasets. **Fine-tuning** adapts that pre-trained model to a **specific domain or task** using additional targeted data.
