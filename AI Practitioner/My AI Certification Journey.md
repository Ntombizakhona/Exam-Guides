## My AI Certification Journey (and Resources to Certify With Confidence)

I haven’t found a single, fully AWS-centric, one-size-fits-all course for the AWS Certified AI Practitioner exam, at least not yet. That’s probably due to the ever-evolving nature of the AI landscape. As more people take the exam, we’ll likely see more targeted and tailored training paths emerge.

That said, if you’re already comfortable with [Task Statement 3.7](https://dev.to/aws-builders/identify-aws-artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning-aiml-servicesand-analytics-services-402n) of the AWS Cloud Practitioner, you should be in a solid position. Think of this exam as an extension of that task statement, with a stronger AI focus.

Yes, the [Cloud Practitioner ](https://dev.to/aws-builders/cloud-practitioner-exam-guide-243h)certification is a helpful prerequisite. But with the unprecedented, widescale adoption of artificial intelligence, I’d argue AI is fast becoming more _general knowledge_ than cloud computing. Honestly, let me iterate, the concepts covered in this exam feel like they should be a formal subsection of the Cloud Practitioner exam, under Task Statement 3.7. And no, I’m not joking.

What stood out to me most is that the exam doesn’t play the “AWS trivia” game. It’s AI-focused. And when you zoom out, the foundations of AI are still the same: Machine Learning + Data, along with the data engineering mindset that supports them. If you focus on mastering those core building blocks, especially and particularly Machine Learning, you won’t just be more prepared for the exam. You’ll build durable AI literacy that stays relevant even as tools and models change.

_**So if your goal is to certify with confidence and also build real intuition around AI systems, these are the resources that helped me most:**_ 👇

### 🧠 Top Resources

#### 1. [AI Escape Room](https://skillbuilder.aws/learn/NBGV3739VA/aws-escape-room-exam-prep-for-aws-certified-ai-practitioner-aifc01/NA3HJ1B3NS)
Genuinely engaging. Gamified learning helps reinforce core concepts through practice. It’s interactive and way more fun than another dull video lecture, not that there is anything wrong with Videos, but at least with immersive, gamified learning, you will resist the urge to multitask and actually acquire and retain the knowledge.

#### 2. [AWS Community Day South Africa (Talks)](https://ntombizakhona.medium.com/aws-community-day-5eb39de56a0b)
I attended this the week before my exam, and the talks made a difference. Real-world use cases and stories about how people are deploying AI/ML on AWS gave me context that stuck.  
They probably weren’t recorded (unfortunately), but this space evolves fast. Events and meetups where people are discussing AI in real time are gold, what you hear today might be tomorrow’s exam topic.

#### 3. [Books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/148454864-ntombizakhona-mabaso)
I read everything from the skeptical to the sensational to the strictly technical. Books offer a structured, deep-dive format that helped me synthesize ideas, rather than just memorize terms.

#### 4. [CognitiveClass.ai](https://cognitiveclass.ai/)
I’ve been dipping into this platform (formerly Big Data University) for nearly a decade. Their Machine Learning tracks lit the initial spark for me, and I still recommend them. They scale from beginner to advanced content, so you won’t get bored, or lost.

#### 5. [FreeCodeCamp / Andrew Brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZeZZ8_W-M4)
Andrew Brown’s exam prep is clear, practical, and focused. His beginner-friendly tone and exam-centric framing helped me stay two steps ahead.

#### 6. [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/)
Kaggle’s still the OG spot to practice ML and data skills. You’ll get hands-on with notebooks and real datasets, which makes a big difference for retention and intuition.

#### 7. [The AWS “Lenses”](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2025/11/new-aws-well-architected-lenses-ai-ml-workloads/)
Specifically, the [Machine Learning Lens](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/machine-learning-lens/machine-learning-lens.html) and [the Generative AI Lens.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/generative-ai-lens/generative-ai-lens.html) These are excellent resources to connect concepts back to AWS service design and to cover the exam objectives thoroughly.

#### 8. [Nikolai’s Course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-ai-practitioner-aif-c01-exam/?srsltid=AfmBOoq3lyS05PL3URWL1jvyRicEn9azIFJ19vLtP1zybdr0tY89igaT&couponCode=MT260126G1B)
Surprisingly on point. His certification prep nails what you actually need to know.

#### 9. [My Own Article on AI for Beginners](https://medium.com/@ntombizakhona/artificial-intelligence-5028f826c856)
Not to be dramatic, but writing and reflecting on what I learned helped me just as much as reading. Teaching, even just to yourself, forces clarity. Personalized learning styles win, especially when AI helps you iterate and build.

### Bonus Resource

#### 10. “Attention Is All You Need”
Yes, that paper, the one that launched the transformer architecture and changed the game. Even a high-level grasp will help you understand LLMs and foundational model concepts.

### 🔧 How I Used These (Simple Method)

1. **Start broad:** Learn ML and GenAI fundamentals via books and CognitiveClass.ai.
2. **Get practical:** Apply concepts hands-on through Kaggle projects and notebooks.
3. **Go exam-focused:** Use pretests to spot weak areas, then loop back to reinforce.
4. **Add real-world context:** Listen to talks, read articles, and connect ideas to actual AWS services and design choices.

You can pass the exam. But more importantly, you can understand the landscape. And that’s what matters when the tools change faster than the certifications.
