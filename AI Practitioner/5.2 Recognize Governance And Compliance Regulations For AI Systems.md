🤖 **Exam Guide:** AI Practitioner
**Domain 5: Security, Compliance, and Governance for AI Solutions**
📘 _Task Statement 5.2_

## 🎯 Objectives
This task is about understanding how organizations prove their AI systems are controlled, auditable, and compliant. 

Focus on recognizing common compliance standards, knowing which AWS services support audits/governance, and understanding core data governance practices and governance processes.

---

### 1) Regulatory Compliance Standards You Should Recognize

Examples of standards/laws that influence AI systems include:

#### 1.1 **ISO (International Organization for Standardization)**
Broad set of standards used to demonstrate security and quality management controls often relevant to information security programs and risk management.

#### 1.2 **SOC (System and Organization Controls)**
Audit reports (e.g., SOC 1/2/3) that provide assurance about an organization’s controls for security, availability, confidentiality, processing integrity, and privacy.

#### 1.3 **Algorithm Accountability Laws / Regulations**
 Emerging or existing laws requiring transparency, risk management, auditing, and responsible use of automated decision systems especially when decisions impact people.

_You typically won’t be tested on legal details, more on recognizing that regulations exist and drive requirements like auditability, transparency, and controls._

---

### 2) AWS Services/Features That Assist With Governance And Compliance

#### 2.1 **AWS Config**
Tracks and evaluates resource configurations against desired rules which is useful for compliance posture and drift detection.

#### 2.2 **Amazon Inspector**
Helps identify vulnerabilities and security issues commonly for workloads like EC2/container aka “**_vulnerability management”_**.

#### 2.3 **AWS Audit Manager**
Helps collect evidence and map controls to compliance frameworks to reduce manual audit effort.

#### 2.4 **AWS Artifact**
Central place to access AWS compliance reports and agreements, e.g., SOC reports, ISO reports needed for audits.

#### 2.5 **AWS CloudTrail**
Records API activity for auditing (who did what, when).
Which is critical for governance, incident investigation, and proving controls.

#### 2.6 **AWS Trusted Advisor**
Provides recommendations across cost, performance, security, and fault tolerance including security checks that can support governance goals.

---

### 3) Data Governance Strategies

Key strategies you should be able to describe:

#### 3.1 **Data Lifecycle Management**
 Define how data is collected, stored, used (training/inference), shared, archived, and deleted.

#### 3.2 **Logging**
Record access and important events such as data access, model endpoint calls and admin changes to support audits and investigations.

#### 3.3 **Residency**
Ensure data stays in required geographic locations/Regions to satisfy regulatory or contractual obligations.

#### 3.4 **Monitoring / Observation**
Monitor for policy violations, abnormal access, drift, and operational issues to support ongoing compliance.

#### 3.5 **Retention**
Keep data/logs for required durations, then dispose of them safely when no longer needed, you should _avoid keeping sensitive data longer than necessary._

---

### 4) Processes To Follow Governance Protocols

Governance is not just tools, it’s repeatable processes.

**Common governance processes include:**

#### 4.1 **Policies**
Written rules for acceptable use, data handling, model usage, human oversight, and incident response.

#### 4.2 **Review Cadence**
Scheduled reviews for models, prompts, datasets, permissions, and controls.

#### 4.3 **Review Strategies**
Human review for high-risk outputs, red-teaming, approvals for model changes, and documented sign-offs.

#### 4.4 **Governance Frameworks**
Use structured frameworks to scope and manage GenAI security risk for example, the **Generative AI Security Scoping Matrix** and align teams on required controls by use case risk level.

#### 4.5 **Transparency Standards**
Documentation and communication about model behavior, limitations, and data usage: model cards, user disclosures, citations where appropriate).

#### 4.6 **Team Training Requirements**
Ensure teams understand privacy, security, compliance, and safe GenAI usage which reduces accidental policy violations
