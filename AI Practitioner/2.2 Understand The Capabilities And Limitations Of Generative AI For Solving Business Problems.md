# Understand The Capabilities And Limitations Of Generative AI For Solving Business Problems

🤖 **Exam Guide:** AI Practitioner
**Domain 2: Fundamentals of Generative AI **
📘_Task Statement 2.2_

## 🎯 Objectives
This task is about making good business decisions with GenAI: knowing what it’s great at, where it fails, how to pick the right model for the job, and how to measure success beyond “_the demo looked good_.”

---

### 1) Advantages of GenAI

#### 1.1 **Adaptability**
One model can perform many tasks with minimal changes (often just by changing the prompt).
**Example:** 
The same LLM can 

1. summarize
2. classify 
3. extract fields
4. draft emails
5. and answer questions

#### 1.2 **Responsiveness**
Produces outputs quickly and interactively, enabling real-time experiences (assistants, copilots).
**Supports iterative refinement:** user can correct and the model can respond immediately.

#### 1.3 **Simplicity**
You can often deliver useful functionality without building a custom ML pipeline.
_Prompting + retrieval can replace complex rules-based systems or multiple specialized NLP models._

#### 1.4 **Works Well With Unstructured Data**
**Especially strong for text-heavy workflows:** 

1. tickets
2. documents 
3. chats 
4. knowledge bases

#### 1.5 **Cross-Domain Generalization**
Foundation models can handle tasks across domains (legal, HR, IT, marketing) better than narrow models *without* starting from scratch.

### 2) Disadvantages And Limitations of GenAI

#### 2.1 **Hallucinations**
The model may generate confident but incorrect information.
_Risk increases when prompts are vague, context is missing, or the question requires precise factual grounding._

#### 2.2 **Interpretability**
Hard to explain *why* the model produced a specific output.
_This matters in regulated or high-stakes decisions._

#### 2.3 **Inaccuracy**
Even when not _“hallucinating,”_ outputs can be partially wrong, incomplete, or misaligned with business rules.
_LLMs are not guaranteed to be factually correct or up-to-date._

#### 2.4 **Nondeterminism**
Outputs can vary between runs even with the same prompt (depending on sampling/temperature and system behavior).
_Makes strict reproducibility and test assertions harder than traditional software._

#### 2.5 **Other Practical Constraints**
1. **Data privacy/security**: prompts may contain sensitive data; requires controls.
2. **Latency and cost**: larger models can be slow/expensive at scale.
3. **Context window limits**: cannot “read everything”; needs chunking/retrieval strategies.
4. **Policy and safety concerns**: risk of toxic output, leakage of sensitive info, or policy violations.

### 3) Factors For Selecting The Right GenAI Model

When choosing a GenAI approach or model, consider:

#### 3.1 **Model Type / Modality**
Text-only LLM vs multimodal model (text+image) vs image generation (diffusion), etc.
_Choose based on required inputs/outputs (text, image, audio, video)._

#### 3.2 **Performance Requirements**
1. **Latency Targets:** interactive chat vs offline processing
2. **Throughput / Concurrency:** how many requests
3. Cost per request and budget constraints

#### 3.3 **Capability fit**
Does the model perform well on your task?
  1. Summarization quality
  2. Instruction following
  3. Tool/function calling (if building agents)
  4. Domain-specific language

#### 3.4 **Constraints**
1. **Context length needs:** long documents may require retrieval
2. **Output format needs:** JSON, strict templates
3. **Reliability requirements:** do you need citations/grounding?

#### 3.5 **Compliance and Governance**

1. Data residency requirements
2. PII handling and retention policies
3. Audit/logging needs
4. **Model/provider restrictions:** acceptable use, training data policies

#### 3.6 **Customization Needs**

1. Can **Prompting / RAG** meet requirements?
2. Do you need **Fine-tuning** for tone, style, or domain patterns?
3. Do you need **Guardrails** and validation layers?

### 4) Determine Business Value And Metrics for GenAI Applications

GenAI success should be measured with both **Model Quality** and **Business Outcomes**.

#### 4.1 **Business Value Examples**

1. Reduced agent handling time (AHT) in support
2. Higher conversion rate from better product discovery
3. Faster content creation cycles for marketing
4. Reduced cost of operations via automation
5. Improved customer satisfaction through better self-service

#### 4.2 Example Metrics 
##### 4.2.1 **Cross-Domain Performance**
How well the solution generalizes across different departments/topics without rework.
**Metric Example:** _task success rate across multiple knowledge domains_.

##### 4.2.2 **Efficiency**
Time saved, fewer manual steps, reduced escalations.
**Metric Examples:** 

1. AHT (Average Handle Time)
2. Tickets Resolved Per Hour
3. Cost Per Case

##### 4.2.3 **Conversion Rate**
Improved purchase or signup completion due to better guidance or recommendations.
**Metric Example: ** _checkout conversion uplift after assistant launch._

##### 4.2.4 **Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)**
Monetization impact 
**Metric Example:** _ARPU increase for users exposed to assistant/recommendations._

##### 4.2.5 **Accuracy**
Must be defined for the task, e.g., correct extraction fields, correct classification.
Metric Examples:

1. human-rated correctness
2. exact match for extracted fields 
3. grounded answer rate.

##### 4.2.6 **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**
Long-term retention or loyalty impact.
**Metric example:** _churn reduction in cohorts that use GenAI support._

_**Pick metrics aligned to the business goal. A model can be “impressive” but still fail if it doesn’t improve efficiency, revenue, or customer outcomes or if risk/cost is too high.**_

### ✅ _Answers to Quick Questions_

**1.** **Adaptability** (one model can handle many tasks via prompting) and **responsiveness** (interactive, real-time outputs).  
   *(Simplicity/time-to-value is also a valid advantage.)*

**2.** A **hallucination** is when the model generates information that sounds confident but is **incorrect or fabricated**. It’s risky because it can mislead users, create compliance/legal issues, and damage trust _(especially if presented as fact)._

**3.** **One reason nondeterminism is a production problem** is that the same prompt can yield **different outputs** across runs, which makes results harder to **test, reproduce, and consistently control** for quality or policy compliance.

**4.** **Compliance/governance requirements** _(PII handling, audit/logging, data residency)_ and **interpretability/reliability needs** _(e.g., grounded answers, stricter controls/guardrails, lower risk of hallucinations)._  
   *(Latency/cost and provider policies are also valid factors.)*

**5.** **Conversion rate** (e.g., increased checkout completion) or **ARPU** (average revenue per user).
