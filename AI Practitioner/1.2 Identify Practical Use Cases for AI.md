# Identify Practical Use Cases for AI

🤖 **Exam Guide:** AI Practitioner
**Domain 1:  Fundamentals of AI and ML**
📘_Task Statement 1.2_

## 🎯 Objectives
This task is about deciding **when AI is useful**, **when it isn’t**, and matching common business problems to the right **ML technique** and **AWS managed AI service**.

---

### 1) Where AI/ML Can Provide Value

AI/ML tends to add the most value when you need to:

#### 1.1 **Assist Human Decision-Making:**

_Examples:_

1. underwriting support
2. clinical triage support
3. prioritizing support tickets
4. sales lead scoring

#### 1.2 **Scale Decisions That Humans Can’t Make Repeatedly**

_Examples:_

1. moderating content at scale
2. routing millions of requests
3. ranking products for every user

#### 1.3 **Automate Pattern Recognition**
_Examples:_

1. detecting defects in manufacturing images
2. identifying fraud patterns
3. extracting entities from documents

#### 1.4 **Personalize Experiences**
_Examples:_

1. recommendations
2. targeted offers
3. personalized search ranking

#### 1.5 **Improve Predictions and Forecasting**
_Examples:_

1. demand forecasting
2. inventory planning
3. ETA prediction 
4. churn probability

#### 1.6 **Handle Unstructured Data**
_Examples:_

1. text _(emails, chats)_
2. audio _(call center)_
3. images/video _(security footage)_

_AI is strong at *probabilistic prediction* and *pattern discovery*, not guaranteed correctness._

---

### 2) When AI/ML is *Not* Appropriate

AI may be the wrong choice when:

#### 2.1 **A Deterministic Answer Is Required**
If you need a guaranteed correct output every time (_e.g., tax calculation rules, compliance logic)_, use rules/logic, not ML.

#### 2.2 **There’s No Data or Poor-Quality Data**
No representative historical data → models won’t generalize.

#### 2.3 **Cost or Complexity Outweighs Benefit**
ML introduces ongoing costs: 

1. data collection
2. monitoring
3. drift
4. retraining
5. governance.

#### 2.4  **The Process is Stable and Well-Defined**
Simple rules and workflows can be cheaper, faster, and more explainable.

#### 2.5  **High-Risk Decisions Require Strict Explainability**
In regulated contexts, a simpler model or non-ML approach might be required for auditability.

#### 2.6 **You Can’t Tolerate Model Error**
ML outputs are _probabilistic_, even high accuracy still means some mistakes.

#### **Cost-Benefit Framing**
**If a _rules-based_ solution can meet requirements with low maintenance, prefer it.**
_Use ML when the pattern is complex, data-driven, and value justifies ongoing lifecycle management._

### 3) Select The Appropriate ML Technique For A Use Case

#### Mapping

| Use case | Typical technique | Output |
|---|---|---|
| Predict house price, demand, revenue | **Regression** | Number (continuous) |
| Spam detection, churn yes/no, fraud yes/no | **Classification** | Category/label |
| Segment customers, group similar products | **Clustering** (unsupervised) | Groups/segments |
| Detect unusual transactions/sensors | **Anomaly detection** | Outlier score/flag |
| Forecast sales over time | **Time-series forecasting** | Future values |
| Rank products or pages | **Recommendation / ranking** | Ordered list |

#### **Quick Decision Guide**

1. - “How much / how many?” → **Regression**
2. - “Which category?” → **Classification**
3. - “Find groups with no labels” → **Clustering**
4. - “Find weird/rare events” → **Anomaly detection**
5. - “Predict the future from time” → **Forecasting**

---

### 4) Examples of Real-World AI Applications

#### 4.1 **Computer vision**

1. Defect detection
2. face blur
3. safety monitoring
4. OCR + form extraction

#### 4.2 **NLP**

1. Sentiment analysis
2. entity extraction
3. ticket classification
4. summarization
5. search

#### 4.3 **Speech Recognition**

1. Transcribing calls
2. meeting notes
3. call analytics
 
#### 4.4 **Recommendation systems**

1. “Customers also bought” 
2. content feeds 
3. personalized search ranking

#### 4.5 **Fraud detection**
Flag suspicious payments or account behavior

#### 4.6 **Forecasting**

1. Predict demand
2. staffing needs 
3. inventory 
4. traffic
5. energy usage

### 5) Capabilities of AWS managed AI/ML Services 

These AWS services let you use AI without building everything from scratch.

#### Core Services 

#### 5.1 **Amazon SageMaker AI**
Managed platform to **build, train, and deploy ML models**
_Amazon Sagemaker AI includes tools for:_

1. data prep
2. training jobs
3. endpoints for inference
4. monitoring 

#### 5.2 **Amazon Transcribe**
**Speech-to-text** service that convert audio to text

_Amazon Transcribe Common Use Cases:_ 

1. call center transcription
2. meeting transcription
3. voice analytics pipelines

#### 5.3 **Amazon Translate**
 **Machine translation** between languages

_Amazon Translate Common Use Cases:_ 

1. multilingual support content
2. translation of chats/tickets

#### 5.4 **Amazon Comprehend**
**NLP for text analysis**
_Amazon Comprehend Common Features:_ 

1. sentiment
2. key phrases
3. entities
4. language detection
5. topic modeling/classification 

#### 5.5 **Amazon Lex**
Build **chatbots and voice bots**
