# Describe the ML Development Cycle

🤖 **Exam Guide:** AI Practitioner
**Domain 1:  Fundamentals of AI and ML**
📘_Task Statement 1.3_

## 🎯 Objectives
This task tests whether you understand **how ML goes from Idea → Production → Ongoing Operations**, what each pipeline stage does, and which **AWS SageMaker** features commonly map to each stage. It also checks that you can distinguish **model metrics** from **business metrics**.

---

### 1) Components of an ML Pipeline (end-to-end)

A typical ML lifecycle is iterative because you often loop back after evaluation/monitoring:

#### 1.1 **Data Collection**
Gather raw data from sources such as applications, databases, logs, sensors, third-party datasets, etc.
**Goal:** _Ensure the data represents the real production environment._

#### 1.2 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
Inspect data shape/quality and discover patterns.
**Common EDA Activities:** 

1. missing values
2. outliers 
3. class imbalance
4. correlations
5. label distribution

#### 1.3 **Data Pre-processing**
Clean and prepare data so it can be used by algorithms.
**Examples:**

1. handling missing values 
2. normalization/standardization
3. encoding categories
4. train/val/test split

#### 1.4 **Feature Engineering**
Create or transform input variables _(“features”)_ that improve model performance.
Examples: 

1. aggregations _(spend last 30 days)_, 
2. time-based features _(day of week)_, 
3. text vectorization/embeddings.

#### 1.5 **Model Training**
Fit a model to training data to learn parameters.
**Output:** a trained model artifact.

#### 1.6 **Hyperparameter Tuning**
Search over hyperparameters to improve performance such as learning rate and tree depth.
**Note:** *Model parameters are learned, hyperparameters are chosen.*

#### 1.7 **Evaluation**
Measure performance on validation/test data.
**Compare candidates and check generalization:** look for bias, drift risk, failure modes.

#### 1.8 **Deployment**
Make the model available to applications (real-time endpoint or batch scoring job).

#### 1.9 **Monitoring**
Track model + data behavior in production such as performance, drift, latency, errors and trigger alerts and retraining when needed.

### 2) Sources of ML models

You generally get models from two paths:

#### 2.1 **Open-source or Pre-trained Models**
Start from a model already trained on broad data and adapt it or use it directly.
**Pros:** faster, cheaper, strong baseline.
_ Cons:_ may not match your domain, requires governance/licensing review.

#### 2.2 **Custom-trained models**
Train using your organization’s labeled data and problem definition.
**Pros:** tailored to your use case.
_Cons:_ needs data, time, ML expertise, and ongoing maintenance.

_know when **“use existing”** vs **“train custom”** is appropriate based on data availability, uniqueness, and cost._

---

### 3) Methods to use a model in production

Common production serving approaches:

#### 3.1 **Managed API service**
Cloud provider hosts the endpoint and handles scaling/ops.
**Pros:** faster to deploy, less operational burden, built-in monitoring integrations.
_Cons:_ less low-level control, cost tradeoffs.

#### 3.2 **Self-hosted API**
You run the model server yourself (e.g., on containers/VMs).
**Pros:** maximum control over runtime, networking, custom dependencies.
_Cons:_ you manage scaling, reliability, patching, monitoring.

_Also remember the inference mode choice:_
**Real-time inference** → low latency per request
**Batch inference** → high throughput for large jobs

### 4) AWS Services/Features Mapped to Pipeline Stages 

| Pipeline stage | AWS service / feature | What it helps with |
|---|---|---|
| Data prep / EDA | **Amazon SageMaker Data Wrangler** | Visual/automated data cleaning, transformations, basic analysis workflows |
| Feature management | **Amazon SageMaker Feature Store** | Central place to store, reuse, and serve features consistently for training and inference |
| Training / tuning / deployment | **Amazon SageMaker** (SageMaker AI) | Managed environment to train models, run tuning jobs, and deploy endpoints |
| Monitoring | **Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor** | Detect data quality issues and model drift; monitor inference data vs baseline |

(Just fyi. other AWS services exist, but these are the ones **explicitly** called out in the task objectives, you should always head over to the AWS Console and peruse, observe, experiment & build!)

### 5) Fundamental Concepts of MLOps

**MLOps** is all about applying engineering practices to ML so it can run reliably in production.

Key themes you should be able to explain:

#### 5.1 **Experimentation**
Track runs: 

1. datasets
2. features
3. model versions
4. hyperparameters 
5. metrics

**Goal:** reproducibility and learning faster.

#### 5.2 **Repeatable Processes**
Automated pipelines reduce manual errors _(consistent preprocessing, training, evaluation)._

#### 5.3 **Scalable Systems**
Ability to train/serve as data and traffic grow.

#### 5.4 **Managing Technical Debt**
ML systems can become fragile due to hidden dependencies on data, features, and environment.

 **Debt Examples:** 

1. undocumented preprocessing steps
2. inconsistent features between training/inference

#### 5.5 **Production Readiness**

1. reliability 
2. security 
3. testing
4. rollback strategy
5. monitoring 
6. documentation

#### 5.6 **Model Monitoring**
Monitor input data distribution changes, prediction distribution changes, latency, errors.

#### 5.7 **Model Retraining**
Refresh models when performance degrades due to drift, seasonality, or business changes.

### 6) Model Performance Metrics vs Business Metrics

#### **ML / Model metrics _(Technical)_**
Used to measure predictive performance:

1 **Accuracy:** % of correct predictions (can be misleading with class imbalance).
2 **AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve):** Measures ability to rank positives higher than negatives across thresholds, and is useful for imbalanced classification.
3 **F1 score:** Harmonic mean of precision and recall, and is useful when false positives and false negatives both matter.

#### **Business Metrics _(Outcome)_**
Used to measure whether the model is worth it:

1 **Cost per user / cost per prediction**
2 **Development and operational costs**
3 **Customer feedback / satisfaction**
4 **ROI (Return on Investment)**

_A model can have strong ML metrics but fail in business terms (too expensive, too slow, harms user experience, increases risk)._

### ✅ _Answers to Quick Questions_

#### 1. **Training vs deployment**
**Training**: learning model parameters from historical data to create a trained model artifact.

**Deployment**: making the trained model available for use in production (e.g., as an endpoint/API or batch job) so it can serve inference.

#### 2. **Why accuracy can be misleading in fraud detection**
Fraud is often **rare** (class imbalance). A model can predict “not fraud” for everything and still achieve very high accuracy, while being useless. Metrics like **AUC**, **precision/recall**, and **F1** are often more informative.

#### 3. **What problem Feature Store helps prevent**
**Training/serving skew** and inconsistent features (e.g., using one definition of a feature during training and a different definition in production), plus duplicated feature logic across teams.

#### 4. **One sign you might need retraining**
**Model performance degrades in production** or monitoring shows **data drift/concept drift** (input distributions or real-world relationships change over time).

#### 5. **One model metric and one business metric**
Model metric: **F1 score** (or accuracy/AUC).
Business metric: **ROI** (or cost per user, development/operating cost, customer satisfaction).
