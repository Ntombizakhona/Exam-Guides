📘_Task Statement 3.4_

## 🎯 Objectives
This task is about evaluating whether an FM (and an FM-powered application like RAG or an agent) is *good enough*, not just in a demo, but against repeatable criteria using human review, benchmarks, and objective metrics tied to business goals.

---

### 1) Approaches To Evaluate FM performance

#### 1.1 **Human Evaluation**
People review model outputs and score them against criteria such as:
  **_1_** correctness/helpfulness
  **_2_** clarity and tone
  **_3_** completeness
  **_4_** safety/policy compliance
**Best for:** subjective qualities and real user experience.
**Tradeoff:** _slower and more expensive, but often the most reliable indicator._

#### 1.2 **Benchmark Datasets**
Use a fixed dataset (prompts + expected outputs) and evaluate consistently over time.
**Best for:** regression testing, comparing models/prompts, measuring improvement.
**Tradeoff:** _benchmarks may not reflect your exact domain and can be “gamed” if over-optimized._

#### 1.3 **Amazon Bedrock Model Evaluation**
A managed way to evaluate and compare model outputs,
**Useful for** standardized evaluation workflows across prompts/models.

### 2) Metrics To Assess FM Performance
These metrics compare generated text to a reference (ground truth). They’re most useful when you *have* expected answers (e.g., translation pairs, reference summaries).

#### 2.1 **ROUGE** 
##### **Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation**
**ROUGE** is common for **summarization**, it measures overlap between generated and reference text (often n-grams).
**Recall-oriented:** _focuses on how much of the reference content was captured._

#### 2.2 **BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy)**
**BLEU** is common for **machine translation**, it measures n-gram precision (how much generated text matches the reference translation).

#### 2.3 **BERTScore**
**BERTScore** uses embeddings from transformer models (e.g., BERT-like) to measure **semantic similarity**, not just exact word overlap.
**Useful when** _wording differs but meaning is similar._

_**No single metric proves “quality.” Metrics can be paired with human evaluation and task-specific checks.**_

### 3) Determine Whether The FM Meets Business Objectives

FM quality must translate into outcomes that matter.

Examples of business objective alignment:

#### 3.1 **Productivity**
Time saved per task, faster drafting, fewer manual steps, reduced handling time.

#### 3.2 **User Engagement**
Retention, session length, repeat usage, satisfaction ratings.

#### 3.3 **Task Success / Task Engineering**
Whether users can reliably complete the intended task (e.g., extract fields correctly, create a correct ticket, answer questions with citations).

_**A model can score well on ROUGE/BLEU but still fail business goals if it’s too slow, too expensive, unsafe, or doesn’t improve user outcomes.**_

---

### 4) Evaluating FM-based Applications 
#### RAG, agents, workflows

It’s not enough to evaluate the base model, you must evaluate the *system*.

#### 4.1 **RAG Evaluation**
Evaluate:
**_1_** **Retrieval Quality:** Are the right documents/chunks being retrieved?
**_2_** **Grounding:** Does the answer use the retrieved context _and avoid making things up_?
**_3_** **Answer Quality:** Correctness, completeness, citations, and refusal behavior when context is missing.

#### 4.2 **Common Application Metrics:**
**_1_** grounded answer rate / citation accuracy
**_2_** retrieval recall/precision (did we fetch relevant chunks?)
**_3_** hallucination rate (answers not supported by sources)

#### 4.3 **Agent / Workflow Evaluation**
Evaluate:
**_1_** **Task completion rate:** Did the agent finish the multi-step objective?
**_2_** **Tool correctness:** Did it call the right tool with correct parameters?
**_3_** **Safety/compliance:** Did it attempt disallowed actions or expose sensitive data?
**_4_** **Efficiency:** Number of steps/tool calls, latency, cost per completed task.

### 💡 **Quick Questions**

**1.** What’s one advantage of **human evaluation** over automated metrics?
**2.** Which metric is commonly associated with **summarization**: ROUGE or BLEU?
**3.** What is **BERTScore** trying to measure that ROUGE/BLEU may miss?
**4.** Name one way to evaluate a **RAG** application beyond “is the answer good?”
**5.** Give one example of a **business metric** you might use to evaluate an FM-powered assistant.

### ✅ _Answers to Quick Questions_

**1.** Humans can judge qualities that automated metrics struggle with, such as **helpfulness, tone, clarity, policy compliance, and real-world correctness** in context.

**2.** **ROUGE** is commonly used for **summarization**.  
   *(BLEU is more commonly used for translation.)*

**3.** **Semantic similarity/meaning**, even when the wording is different (not just exact n-gram overlap).

**4.** Evaluate **retrieval quality** (e.g., whether the system retrieves the most relevant chunks/documents) and **grounding** (whether answers are supported by retrieved sources).

**5.** **Productivity/time saved** (e.g., reduced average handling time), **user engagement/retention**, or **conversion rate** (depending on the use case).
