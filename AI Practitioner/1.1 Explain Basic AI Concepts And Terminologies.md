📘_Task Statement 1.1_

## 🎯 Objectives 

This task is about building a shared vocabulary: what core AI terms mean, how major categories relate (**AI** vs **ML** vs **Deep Learning** vs **GenAI**), and how learning/inference/data types differ.

### 1) Basic AI Terms

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)**
Artificial Intelligence is the broad field focused on creating systems that perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence _(perception, reasoning, language, decision-making)._

**Machine Learning (ML)**
Machine Learning is a subset of AI where systems learn patterns from data to make predictions/decisions, rather than being explicitly programmed with rules.

**Deep Learning (DL)**
Deep Learning is a subset of ML that uses **neural networks with many layers** to learn complex patterns _(especially effective for images, audio, and text)._

**Neural Network**
A Neural Network is a model inspired by brain-like structures. It learns by adjusting **weights** to minimize errors. Deep learning uses large multi-layer neural networks.

**Computer Vision**
Computer Vision systems are AI methods that interpret images/video _(e.g., object detection, classification, OCR _**(Optical Character Recognition)**_ , segmentation)._

**Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
Natural Language Processing systems are AI methods that understand/generate human language such as _classification, translation, summarization and chat_

**Model**
The Model is the trained artifact that maps inputs **→** outputs, for example “given features **→** predict churn”). In deep learning, the model includes network architecture + learned weights.

**Algorithm**
An Algorithm is the procedure used to learn or compute outcomes. In Machine Learning, it often refers to the learning approach such as _logistic regression, decision trees_, and the optimization method.

**Training**
Training is the process of learning model parameters from data like adjusting weights/parameters to reduce loss.

**Inference (Inferencing)**
Inferencing is using a trained model to produce outputs for new inputs: predictions, classifications, generated text, etc.

**Fit**
_Fit_ is how well a model’s learned pattern matches the true relationship in the data.
  - ***Underfitting***: too simple. The model performs poorly on training and test.
  - ***Overfitting***: memorizes training. The model performs well on training but poorly on new data.

**Bias**
Bias in the context of Responsible AI is systematic unfair differences in outcomes across groups due to data, modeling choices, or deployment context.
**Note:** the **ML term** _bias_  is different, as in _bias-variance tradeoff_). In the AI exam, a bias related question usually means **fairness-related bias** unless, of-course stated otherwise. 

**Fairness**
Fairness is the goal of reducing unjustified performance gaps or unequal outcomes across groups demographic parity and equalized odds. Demographic parity and equalized odds are just fairness metrics.

**Large Language Model (LLM)**
A Large Language Model is a foundation model trained on large corpora of text to understand and or generate language.
**Capabilities of LLMs:** 
1. summarization, 
2. Q&A, 
3. drafting, 
4. extraction, 
5. classification, 
6. "reasoning" (with limitations).

### 2) **AI vs ML vs GenAI vs Deep Learning**
### Similarities and Differences
I am sure you have seen the circle or variations of it that explain the relationship  between AI, ML, DL, and GenAI: So I prompted an Image Generation LLM Model to create my variation of it.

#### Quick hierarchy
- **AI** (broadest)
  - **ML** (learns from data)
    - **Deep Learning** (ML using multi-layer neural networks)



**Generative AI (GenAI)**
Generative AI is a category of AI (often deep-learning-based) that **generates new content** such as text, images, code, audio, video.
GenAI is frequently implemented using **foundation models** such as LLMss

#### Comparison table

| Term | What it means | Typical outputs | Example tasks |
|---|---|---|---|
| AI | Broad umbrella for intelligent behavior | Decisions/actions/content | Planning, perception, language |
| ML | Learns patterns from data | Predictions or classifications | Fraud detection, churn prediction |
| Deep Learning | ML using deep neural networks | Predictions + representations | Vision, speech, NLP |
| GenAI | Generates new content | Text/images/code/audio | Summarization, chat, image generation |

***Similarities:*** All aim to solve problems by using data and computation to achieve intelligent behavior.

***Differences:*** ML/DL often focus on **predicting** labels/values. GenAI focuses on **creating** new content, often probabilistically.

### 3) Types of Inferencing

**Real-time Inference:** Low-latency predictions per request (milliseconds to seconds), _used for interactive apps such as chatbots, recommendations, fraud checks at checkout._

**Key Concerns:** _latency, concurrency, autoscaling, cost per request._

**Batch inference:** Run predictions on many records at once (minutes to hours), _used for nightly scoring jobs, large dataset enrichment, periodic reporting.
_
**Key Concerns:** _throughput, scheduling, cost efficiency._

_If a user is waiting for the response_ → **real-time**.
_If results are needed on a schedule or for a large dataset_ → **batch**.

### 4) Types of Data in AI models

#### By Labeling
- **Labeled Data**: has input + correct output/label (used in supervised learning)
  - Example: emails labeled “spam”/“not spam”
- **Unlabeled Data**: inputs only (commonly used in unsupervised learning or pretraining)
  - Example: a folder of images with no tags

#### By Structure
- **Structured Data**: organized in rows/columns with a schema
  - Example: SQL tables, CSV with fixed columns
- **Unstructured data**: free-form content
  - Example: documents, images, audio, raw text
- **Semi-structured Data** (often mentioned): has some structure but flexible schema
  - Example: JSON, logs

#### By Modality 
- **Tabular**: rows/columns _(customer attributes, transactions)_
- **Time-series**: ordered by time _(IoT sensor readings, stock prices)_
- **Image**: photos, medical scans
- **Text**: emails, tickets, documents, chat logs

### 5) Supervised Learning vs Unsupervised Learning vs Reinforcement Learning

**Supervised Learning:** Learns from labeled examples (X → y).
- Common tasks:
  - *Classification*: predict a category (spam vs not spam)
  - *Regression*: predict a number (house price)
- Typical success metrics: accuracy/F1 (classification), RMSE/MAE (regression)

**Unsupervised Learning:** Learns patterns from unlabeled data (X only).
- Common tasks:
  - *Clustering*: group similar items (customer segmentation)
  - *Dimensionality reduction*: compress features for visualization or efficiency

**Reinforcement Learning (RL):** An agent learns by interacting with an environment to maximize a **reward**.
**Key Reinforcement Learning Concepts:** agent, environment, state, action, reward, policy.
**Common Reinforcement Learning Tasks:** robotics, game playing, dynamic resource allocation.

#### Quick Selection Guide

| If you have… | You likely use… | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Inputs + correct labels | Supervised | Predict churn from customer features |
| Inputs only, want structure/groups | Unsupervised | Segment customers by behavior |
| A sequence of decisions with rewards | Reinforcement learning | Optimize bidding/robot navigation |
