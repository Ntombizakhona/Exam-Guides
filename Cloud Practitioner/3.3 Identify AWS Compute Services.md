# Identify AWS Compute Services

🧠**Exam Guide:** Cloud Practitioner
**Domain 3: Cloud Technology & Services**
📘_Task Statement 3.3_


## 🎯What Is This Task Testing?
You need to recognize AWS compute options and match them to scenarios:
- **Amazon EC2** and common **Instance Families** (compute optimized, storage optimized, etc.)
- **Container** services (Amazon ECS, Amazon EKS)
- **Serverless Compute** (AWS Lambda) and **Serverless Container Compute** (AWS Fargate)
- **Elasticity** via Auto Scaling
- The purpose of **Load Balancers**



## 1) 🖥️ Amazon EC2 
### Virtual Servers
**Amazon EC2** provides resizable virtual servers. Can you choose the right instance type for a workload?

### Compute Optimized
**Compute Optimized Instances Are Best For:** CPU-heavy workloads  
**Examples:** high-performance web servers, batch processing, gaming servers, some HPC tasks

**_"Words"_ Associated With Compute Optimized Instances:** _“CPU intensive,” “high compute,” “needs lots of processing power.”_

### Storage Optimized
**Storage Optimized Instances Are Best For:** high, fast local storage access (high IOPS/throughput)  
**Examples:** data warehousing, log processing, distributed file systems, workloads needing very fast local disk

**_"Words"_ Associated With Storage Optimized Instances:** _“high I/O,” “low-latency storage,” “lots of reads/writes,” “high throughput.”_

*(You might also see other families on exams, like memory optimized or general purpose, but compute-optimized and storage-optimized are common callouts, and the wording is self-explanatory, it shouldn't be hard to figure out.)*



## 2) 🧩 Containers
Containers package code and dependencies so applications run consistently.

### Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service)
A managed container orchestration service from AWS.

**Amazon ECS is Best For:**
- running containers without needing Kubernetes
- teams that want AWS-native simplicity
- microservices and batch/container workloads

_“Run containers with a simpler AWS-managed orchestrator”_ → **ECS**.



### Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)
A managed service to run **Kubernetes** on AWS.

**Amazon EKS is Best For:**
- organizations already using Kubernetes
- portability across Kubernetes environments
- needing the Kubernetes ecosystem and tooling

_“Need Kubernetes”_ → **EKS**.



## 3) ⚡ Serverless Compute Options 
### AWS Lambda
Runs code in response to events without managing servers.

**AWS Lambda is Best For:**
- event-driven workloads (file uploads, API calls, scheduled jobs)
- short-running tasks and automation
- rapid development where you don’t want server management

_“Run code without provisioning servers” / “event-driven”_ → **Lambda**.



### AWS Fargate
A serverless compute engine for containers (works with ECS and EKS).

**AWS Fargate is Best For:**
- running containers without managing EC2 worker nodes
- reducing operations overhead while still using containers

 _“Containers but no server/cluster management”_ → **Fargate**.



## 4) 📈 Elasticity with Auto Scaling 
**Auto Scaling** automatically adjusts capacity to match demand.

**Why Auto Scaling Matters:**
- provides **elasticity** (scale out/in based on usage)
- improves availability during traffic spikes
- helps control cost by scaling in when demand drops

_“Traffic is unpredictable” or “need to automatically add/remove instances”_ → **Auto Scaling**.



## 5) ⚖️ Load Balancers
A **Load Balancer** distributes incoming traffic across multiple targets like EC2 instances, containers, or IPs.

**Core Purpose of Load Balancers:**
- **High Availability:** if one target fails, traffic can route to healthy targets
- **Scalability:** supports adding/removing targets without changing the client experience
- **Improved Performance:** spreads traffic to avoid overload

_“Distribute traffic across multiple servers” / “single entry point” / “improve availability”_ → **Load Balancer**.



## ✅ Quick Exam-Style Summary 
- **EC2**: virtual machines, pick instance families based on workload:
  - **compute optimized:** CPU-heavy
  - **storage optimized:** high I/O, fast local storage
- **ECS:**  AWS-managed container orchestration, **EKS:** Kubernetes on AWS.
- **Lambda:** event-driven serverless functions, **Fargate:**  serverless containers.
- **Auto Scaling:** delivers elasticity by scaling capacity up/down automatically.
- **Load balancers:** distribute traffic to improve availability and scale.
