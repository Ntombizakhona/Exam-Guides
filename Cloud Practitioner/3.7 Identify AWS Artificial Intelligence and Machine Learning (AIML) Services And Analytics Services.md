# Identify AWS Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) Services And Analytics Services

📊**Exam Guide:** Cloud Practitioner
**Domain 3: Cloud Technology & Services**
📘_Task Statement 3.7_

## 🎯 What Is This Task Testing?
You need to recognize common AWS services for:
- **AI/ML** and what each service is used for (SageMaker, Lex, Kendra)
- **Analytics** and when to use each service (Athena, Kinesis, Glue, QuickSight)


## 1) 🤖 AWS AI/ML Services
### Amazon SageMaker
A managed service to **build, train, and deploy machine learning models**.

**Use Amazon Sagemaker When:**
- you need an end-to-end ML platform (_data prep, training, tuning, deployment_)
- you want to manage ML workflows without building all tooling yourself

_“train a model,” “deploy an ML model,” “ML lifecycle”_ → **SageMaker**.


### Amazon Lex
A service for building **chatbots and conversational interfaces** (text and voice).

**Use Amazon Lex When:**
- you want a chatbot for customer support, internal help desk, or booking flows
- you need natural language understanding for conversation-style interfaces

_“chatbot,” “conversational interface,” “voice/text bot”_ → **Lex**.


### Amazon Kendra
An **intelligent search** service for searching across large volumes of content (documents, knowledge bases).

**Use Amazon Kendra When:**
- you want enterprise search across documents and internal data sources
- you need more “meaning-based” search than basic keyword matching

_“search documents/knowledge base,” “enterprise search”_ → **Kendra**.


## 2) 🗺️ AWS Analytics Services 
### Ingestion → ETL → Query → Visualization
A helpful way to remember analytics services is by the stage they support.

### Amazon Kinesis: Streaming Ingestion/Processing
A platform for **real-time streaming data**.

**Use Amazon Kinesis When:**
- you need to ingest or process data continuously (clickstreams, IoT telemetry, logs)
- you need near-real-time analytics

_“real-time streams,” “ingest streaming data”_ → **Kinesis**.


### AWS Glue: ETL and Data Integration
A managed service for **ETL (extract, transform, load)** and data preparation.

**Use AWS Glue When:**
- you need to clean/transform and move data between sources and targets
- you need a managed data integration/ETL service

_“ETL,” “transform data,” “prepare data for analytics”_ → **Glue**.


### Amazon Athena: Query Data in S3 Using SQL
A serverless query service that lets you analyze data in **Amazon S3** using **SQL**.

**Use Amazon Athena When:**
- you want ad-hoc queries without managing servers
- your data is already in S3 and you want SQL-based analysis

_“query S3 with SQL,” “serverless interactive queries”_ → **Athena**.


### Amazon QuickSight: Visualization / BI
A business intelligence service for **dashboards and data visualization**.

**Use Amazon QuickSight When:**
- you want interactive dashboards and reporting for stakeholders
- you need BI-style visual analytics

_“dashboards,” “visualize data,” “BI reporting”_ → **QuickSight**.


## _“Match the Service”_ 
- _“Build/train/deploy ML models”_ → **SageMaker**
- _“Create a chatbot”_ → **Lex**
- _“Search across documents/knowledge bases”_ → **Kendra**
- _“Ingest streaming data in real time”_ → **Kinesis**
- _“ETL / data preparation”_ → **Glue**
- _“Run SQL queries directly on S3”_ → **Athena**
- _“Build dashboards and visual reports”_ → **QuickSight**


## ✅ Quick Exam-Style Summary 
- **AI/ML:** SageMaker (_ML platform_), Lex (_chatbots_), Kendra (_intelligent search_).
- **Analytics:** Kinesis (_streaming_), Glue (_ETL_), Athena (_SQL on S3_), QuickSight (_dashboards_).
