# Understand Resources For Billing, Budget, and Cost Management

💸**Exam Guide:** Cloud Practitioner
**Domain 4: Billing, Pricing, and Support**
📘_Task Statement 4.2_

## 🎯 What Is This Task Testing?
You need to know where AWS cost information comes from and which tools answer which questions:
- Where to get **Billing Support and Billing Information**
- Where to find **Pricing Information** for AWS services
- How **AWS Organizations** affects billing (consolidated billing and cost allocation)
- How **Cost Allocation Tags** work and how they show up in reports
- When to use:
  - **AWS Budgets**
  - **AWS Cost Explorer**
  - **AWS Billing Conductor**
  - **AWS Pricing Calculator**
  - **AWS Cost and Usage Report (CUR)**



## 1) 💡 Core Billing and Pricing Information Sources 

### Billing support and billing info
Billing and payments are handled through AWS’s billing tools in the console,AWS provides billing visibility and support options through its billing experience and support plans.

**Typical uses:**
- view invoices and charges
- manage payment methods
- get help with billing issues


### Pricing information for AWS services
AWS pricing information is available publicly on service pricing pages and via estimation tools such as the Pricing Calculator below

_“estimate monthly cost before deploying”_ → **Pricing Calculator**.



## 2) 🧰 Cost Management Tools

### AWS Cost Explorer
AWS Cost Explorer is a tool to **visualize and analyze** your historical AWS spending.

**Use AWS Cost Explorer When:**
- you want to see trends over time (day/month)
- you want to break down costs by service, account, or tag
- you want to identify what’s driving spend increases

_“analyze past spend,” “cost trends,” “break down by service”_ → **Cost Explorer**.



### AWS Budgets
AWS Budgets is a tool to **plan and monitor** spend/usage and send alerts.

**Use AWS Budgets When:**
- you want alerts when cost or usage exceeds (or is forecasted to exceed) a threshold
- you want to enforce budget awareness for teams/projects

_“notify when costs exceed $X” / “budget alerts”_ → **AWS Budgets**.



### AWS Billing Conductor
AWS Billing Conductor is a tool to create **custom billing views and chargeback/showback** (often for organizations that need to present tailored bills to internal teams or customers).

**Use AWS Billing Conductor When:**
- you need to group, re-label, or re-rate costs for internal cost allocation
- you want customized billing views across complex org structures

_“customized billing for business units/tenants,” “chargeback/showback”_ → **Billing Conductor**.



### AWS Pricing Calculator
The AWS Pricing Calculator is used to **estimate** the cost of AWS services before you build.

**Use AWS Pricing Calculator When:**
- you’re planning a new workload and want a cost estimate
- you want to compare architecture options and their expected monthly cost

_“estimate cost ahead of time”_ → **Pricing Calculator**.



## 3) 🏢 AWS Organizations 
### Consolidated Billing and Cost Allocation 
**AWS Organizations** can combine multiple AWS accounts under one organization.

### Consolidated billing 
With consolidated billing:
- you receive **one bill** for multiple accounts
- charges are tracked per member account, but billed centrally
- it supports easier cost management and allocation across accounts

_“multiple accounts, one bill”_ → **consolidated billing with AWS Organizations**.

### Allocation of Costs
Even with one consolidated bill, you can still:
- see costs per account
- allocate costs using tagging strategies



## 4) 🏷️ Cost Allocation Tags and Billing Reports 
**Cost allocation tags** help you label resources so you can track cost by things like:
- department/team
- project
- application
- environment (dev/test/prod)
- cost center

### Types of cost allocation tags 
- **AWS-generated tags**: created by AWS (for certain resources)
- **User-defined tags**: created by you (most common for internal reporting)

### How tags relate to billing reports
Once activated/used properly, tags can appear in:
- **Cost Explorer** breakdowns
- billing reports, including the **AWS Cost and Usage Report (CUR)**


## 5) 🧾 AWS Cost and Usage Report (CUR) 
The **Cost and Usage Report** is AWS’s most detailed billing dataset.

**Use AWS Cost and Usage Report When:**
- you need highly detailed line-item usage and cost data
- you want deep analysis, reporting, or integration with analytics tools

_“most detailed billing report” / “line-item costs and usage”_ → **Cost and Usage Report (CUR)**.



## ✅ Quick Exam-Style Summary 
- **Pricing Calculator**: estimate future cost before deploying
- **Cost Explorer**: analyze historical spend and trends
- **Budgets**: set budgets and get alerts/forecasts
- **Billing Conductor**: custom billing views and chargeback/showback
- **AWS Organizations**: consolidated billing across accounts
- **Cost allocation tags**: attribute spend by team/project/app
- **Cost and Usage Report (CUR)**: most detailed cost/usage data for reporting and analytics
