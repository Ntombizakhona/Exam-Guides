# Define the AWS Global Infrastructure
🌍**Exam Guide:** Cloud Practitioner
**Domain 3: Cloud Technology & Services**
📘_Task Statement 3.2_


## 🎯What Is This Task Testing?

You must be able to explain the building blocks of AWS global infrastructure and how they relate:
- **Regions**, **Availability Zones (AZs)**, and **Edge Locations**
- How AWS infrastructure supports **high availability**
- When to use **multiple AZs** vs **multiple Regions**
- Benefits of **edge locations** (e.g., CloudFront, Global Accelerator)
- What **AWS Local Zones** and **AWS Wavelength Zones** are used for


## 1) 🧱 Core Building Blocks of the AWS Global Infrastructure 

### AWS Regions
A **Region** is a geographic area, for example, a country or part of a continent, that contains multiple Availability Zones:

- You choose a Region when deploying resources.
- Regions help with **data residency/data sovereignty**, **latency**, and **disaster recovery** planning.


### Availability Zones (AZs)
An **Availability Zone** is one or more data centers within a Region designed for fault isolation:

- A Region contains **multiple AZs**.
- AZs are **separate** from each other to reduce the chance that a single failure impacts all of them.
- AZs are connected with **high-bandwidth, low-latency networking**.


### Edge Locations
**Edge locations** are AWS sites designed to bring services closer to end users for lower latency and improved performance:

- Edge locations are commonly associated with content delivery and edge networking services.
- You typically don’t “deploy your whole app” to an edge location the same way you deploy to a Region, instead, AWS services use them to serve content or accelerate traffic.


## 2) 🔗 Relationship Among Regions, AZs, and Edge Locations 
A simple way to visualize it:

- **Region:** a geographic area
- **AZs:** multiple isolated locations *inside* a Region
- **Edge Locations:** distributed sites *closer to users* around the world
 
_You deploy most workloads in a **Region**, design for high availability across **multiple AZs**, and use **Edge Locations** to improve end-user performance._


## 3) 🛡️ Achieving High Availability with Multiple AZs 
High availability means your application continues to run even when something fails.

### How to achieve Hight Availabiity
- Deploy resources across **at least two AZs** in the same Region.
- Use load balancing and redundancy so failure in one AZ does not bring down the application.

### Why multiple AZs matter
**Availability Zones are designed to not share single points of failure.**  
That means a power, cooling, or facility issue in one AZ is less likely to impact another AZ in the same Region.

_“high availability” *within a Region*?_  Then the expected design is a **multi-AZ** solution.


## 4) 🧭 When to Use Multiple Regions 
You use **multiple Regions** when you need separation at a broader geographic level than AZs can provide:
- **Disaster Recovery (DR):** recover if a full Region is unavailable
- **Business Continuity:** maintain operations during major disruptions
- **Low Latency for Global Users:** place workloads closer to different user populations
- **Data Sovereignty/Residency:** keep data in a specific country/Region to meet legal requirements

### Multi-AZ vs Multi-Region
- **Multi-AZ:** high availability within a Region  
- **Multi-Region:** disaster recovery, global reach, sovereignty needs

## 5) ⚡ Benefits of Edge Locations 
Edge locations help reduce latency by moving content and entry points closer to users.

### Amazon CloudFront (CDN)
- Caches and delivers content (web pages, images, video, APIs) from locations near users.
- Improves performance and reduces load on origin infrastructure.

### AWS Global Accelerator
- Improves availability and performance by routing user traffic onto the AWS global network and directing it to optimal regional endpoints.

_“speed up content delivery worldwide”_ → **CloudFront**.  
_“improve global application performance and routing to endpoints”_ → **Global Accelerator**.


## 6) 🧩 AWS Local Zones and AWS Wavelength Zones

### AWS Local Zones
Local Zones place select AWS services **closer to large population/industry centers** to support workloads needing very low latency to a specific metro area.

**Use Local Zones When:** you need low latency to a particular city/metro region (and want AWS-managed infrastructure closer than a traditional Region).


### AWS Wavelength Zones
Wavelength Zones bring AWS services to the **edge of 5G networks** (in partnership with telecom providers).

**Use Wavelength Zones When:** you need ultra-low latency for mobile/5G use cases such as near-real-time gaming, AR/VR, IoT, or video processing close to mobile users.


## ✅ Quick Exam-Style Summary 
- **Region:** geographic area containing multiple **AZs**.
- **AZs:** isolated locations within a Region, designed to avoid shared single points of failure.
- **High Availability:** is commonly achieved by deploying across **multiple AZs**.
- Use **multiple Regions** for DR/business continuity, global low latency, and data sovereignty.
- **Edge locations:** improve end-user performance (_CloudFront_) and traffic routing (_Global Accelerator_).
- **Local Zones:** low latency to specific metro areas.
- **Wavelength Zones:** low latency at the 5G network edge.
