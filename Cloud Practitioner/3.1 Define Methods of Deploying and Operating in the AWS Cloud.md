# Define Methods of Deploying and Operating in the AWS Cloud

🧰**Exam Guide:** Cloud Practitioner
**Domain 3: Cloud Technology & Services**
📘_Task Statement 3.1_

## Another Day, Another Domain

If you’ve ever thought _“I’ll just click around in the console real quick,”_ and suddenly it’s 2 hours later and nothing is documented or deployed, well congrats, you’ve discovered why this domain exists. 

This task is about knowing **how to deploy and operate** on AWS using the right method for the job.


## 🎯What Is This Task Testing?
You must understand:
- Ways of **provisioning and operating** in AWS
- Ways to **access AWS services**
- **Cloud deployment models** (cloud, hybrid, on-premises)
- How to choose between:
  - **AWS Management Console**
  - **Programmatic access** (APIs, SDKs, CLI)
  - **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**


## 1) 🔑 Ways to Access AWS Services 
AWS services can  be accessed in multiple ways.

### AWS Management Console 
#### The Graphical User Interface (GUI)
A web-based interface used for interactive management.

**The AWS Management Console is Best For:**
- learning AWS services
- quick checks and ad-hoc changes
- visually exploring resources and settings

_Manual steps are harder to repeat consistently if you use the console, that's where programmatic access comes in._


### Programmatic Access
#### APIs, SDKs, CLI 
Programmatic access means managing AWS through commands or code.

#### AWS APIs
All actions in AWS are ultimately API calls.

**APIs Are Best For:** automation and integrating AWS actions into applications and pipelines.

#### AWS SDKs
Language-specific libraries (e.g., Python, Java, JavaScript) that call AWS APIs.

**SDKs Are Best For:** building apps that directly interact with AWS services.

#### AWS CLI
Command-line tool to call AWS services.

**The CLI Is Best For:**
- scripting repetitive tasks
- automation from a terminal
- faster operations than clicking through the console


## 2) 🧱 Infrastructure as Code (IaC) 
IaC means defining infrastructure such as networks, servers, permissions, etc. using templates or code instead of a manual setup like the console.

**Why IAC Matters:**
- repeatable deployments
- consistent environments (dev/test/prod)
- version control and change tracking
- reduced configuration drift and human error


## 3) 🔁 One-Time Operations vs Repeatable Processes 
Deciding whether a task should be manual or automated?

### One-time operations
**Examples:** a single quick change, a one-off test, initial learning.

_AWS Management Console (or a simple CLI command)._

### Repeatable processes
**Examples:** launching the same environment for every project, scaling standardized deployments, enforcing consistent configuration.

_IaC and automation (templates + pipelines, CLI scripts, SDK-based tooling)._
 
If you’ll do it more than once, or if consistency matters, lean toward **automation/IaC**.


## 4) 🌍 Cloud Deployment Models 
You must be able to identify common deployment models.

### Cloud 
#### Public Cloud
All workloads run in the cloud (e.g., AWS), with minimal/no on-prem infrastructure.

**Why Organizations Choose The Cloud:** simplicity, scalability, reduced data center management.


### Hybrid 
#### Cloud + On-Premises
Some systems run in AWS, others remain on-premises—connected via networking and identity integrations.

**Why Organizations Choose Hybrid Cloud:**
- regulatory or data residency constraints
- legacy systems that can’t move yet
- phased migration strategy

_“keep some workloads in our data center but extend to AWS,”_ that’s **hybrid**.

---

### Private Cloud
#### On Premises 
Workloads run in a company’s own data center.


## How to Choose the Right Deployment Method 

- **Do you need speed + simplicity right now?** → Console
- **Do you need automation or integration with software?** → API/SDK
- **Do you need scripting and repeatable commands?** → CLI
- **Do you need consistent, repeatable environments with version control?** → IaC


## ✅ Quick Exam-Style Summary 
- AWS access methods: **Console**, **CLI**, **SDK**, **APIs**, and **IaC**.
- Prefer **IaC/automation** for repeatable, standardized deployments.
- Choose deployment models:
  - **Cloud**: everything in AWS
  - **Hybrid**: mix of AWS + on-prem
  - **On-premises**: everything in a private data center
