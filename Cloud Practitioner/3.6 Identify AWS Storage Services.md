📘_Task Statement 3.6_

## 🎯 What Is This Task Testing?
You need to match storage types to scenarios and recognize key AWS storage services:
- **Object storage** use cases (Amazon S3)
- Differences between **Amazon S3 storage classes**
- **Block storage** options (Amazon EBS, instance store)
- **File storage** options (Amazon EFS, Amazon FSx)
- **Cached/hybrid file access** (AWS Storage Gateway)
- When to use **lifecycle policies**
- When to use **AWS Backup**


## 1) 🪣 Object Storage
### Amazon S3
**Object storage** stores data as objects (files + metadata) in buckets.

### Common uses for object storage
- backups and archives
- application assets (_images, videos, static website content_)
- data lakes and analytics storage
- log storage
- distributing large files

_“store files durably,” “buckets,” “static content,” or “data lake,”_ → **Amazon S3**.



## 2) 🗂️ Amazon S3 Storage Classes 
S3 storage classes are designed for different access patterns and cost trade-offs.

- **S3 Standard**:  general-purpose object storage for frequent access
- **S3 Intelligent-Tiering**: automatic tiering when access patterns are unknown or change over time 
- **S3 Standard-IA (_Infrequent Access_)**: less frequent access but still need rapid retrieval
- **S3 One Zone-IA**: infrequent access and lower cost, but stored in a single AZ, less resilient than multi-AZ classes
- **S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval**: archive data that still needs instant access (_rare, but fast retrieval_)
- **S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval**: archive with flexible retrieval times (_minutes to hours_)
- **S3 Glacier Deep Archive**: lowest cost for long-term retention, slowest retrieval (_hours_)


_“lowest cost archive”_ → **Glacier Deep Archive**  
_“unknown access pattern”_ → **Intelligent-Tiering**  
_“infrequent access but immediate retrieval”_ → **Standard-IA** 


## 3) 💽 Block Storage  
Block storage is typically used for operating systems, databases, and applications that need low-latency disk access.

### Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store)
Persistent block storage for EC2 instances.

**Use Amazon EBS When:**
- you need data to **persist** even if an instance stops/terminates 
- you need reliable block storage for boot volumes or databases
- you want snapshots and durability features

_“persistent disk for EC2”_ → **EBS**.


### Instance Store
Temporary block storage physically attached to the host.

**Use Instance Store When:**
- you need very fast temporary storage 
- you can tolerate data loss if the instance stops, terminates, or the host fails

_“ephemeral,” “temporary,” “scratch storage,” “lost when instance stops”_ → **instance store**.


## 4) 📁 File Storage Services (Shared File Systems) 
### Amazon EFS (Elastic File System)
A managed, scalable **Linux** file system that can be mounted by multiple instances.

**Use Amazon EFS When:**
- you need shared file storage across multiple EC2 instances
- you want a managed NFS-style file system for Linux workloads

_“shared Linux file system”_ → **EFS**.


### Amazon FSx
Managed file systems optimized for specific use cases.

**Use Amazon FSx When:**
- you need a managed file system designed for a particular environment/workload (commonly Windows or specialized high-performance file systems)

_“managed Windows file shares” / “specialized file system needs”_ → **FSx**.



## 5) 🗃️ Cached/Hybrid File Systems 
### AWS Storage Gateway
**AWS Storage Gateway** connects on-premises environments to AWS storage.

**AWS Storage Gateway Is Necessary Because:**
- it supports hybrid storage patterns (on-prem apps using AWS-backed storage)
- it can provide **cached access** to frequently used data while storing data in AWS

_“keep on-prem apps, extend storage to AWS,” “cached local access with cloud-backed storage”_ → **Storage Gateway**.


## 6) 🔁 Lifecycle Policies
Lifecycle policies help automatically manage object data in S3 over time.

**Lifecycle Policies Use Cases:**
- move objects between storage classes as they age (e.g., Standard → IA → Glacier)
- expire/delete objects after a retention period
- reduce cost without manual file management

_“automatically transition to cheaper storage after 30/90 days”_ → **S3 lifecycle policy**.


## 7) 🛡️ Centralized Backup Management 
### AWS Backup
**AWS Backup** is a managed service that helps centralize and automate backups across multiple AWS services.

**Use AWS Backup When:**
- you want a single place to define backup plans, schedules, and retention
- you want consistent backup policies across accounts/resources
- you want simplified compliance reporting around backups 

_“centralized backup policy,” “manage backups across services”_ → **AWS Backup**.



## ✅ Quick Exam-Style Summary 
- **Object storage**: Amazon S3 (_buckets, files, backups, data lakes_).
- **S3 storage classes**: choose based on access frequency + archive needs (_Intelligent-Tiering for unknown patterns, Glacier tiers for archives_).
- **Block storage**: **EBS** (_persistent_) vs **instance store** (_temporary/ephemeral_).
- **File storage**: **EFS** (_shared Linux_), **FSx** (_managed file systems for specific needs like Windows_).
- **Hybrid/cached access**: **AWS Storage Gateway**.
- **Lifecycle policies** automate transitions/expiration to cut costs.
- **AWS Backup** centralizes backup scheduling, retention, and management.
