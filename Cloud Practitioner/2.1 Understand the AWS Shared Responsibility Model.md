# Understand the AWS Shared Responsibility Model

🌅 Exam Guide: Cloud Practitioner
**Domain 2: Security & Compliance**
📘_Task Statement 2.1_

### A New Dawn, A New Domain

New year, new you… and new **domain** on the exam. While you’re setting goals like _drink more water_, AWS is setting goals like _keep the cloud from catching fire_. The catch: _some security tasks are yours_. 

Welcome to the **AWS Shared Responsibility Model**.

---

## 🎯 What Is This Task Testing?
You must understand:
- The **AWS shared responsibility model**
- The major **components** of the model
- What **AWS is responsible for**
- What the **customer is responsible for**
- What is **shared**
- How responsibilities **shift depending on the service** (e.g., Amazon EC2 vs Amazon RDS vs AWS Lambda)



## 🧠 The AWS Shared Responsibility Model 
The simplest way to remember it:

- **AWS is responsible for _security OF the cloud_**
- **Customers are responsible for _security IN the cloud_**

This model helps define who handles which security controls, reducing confusion and improving risk management.


## 1)☁️ AWS Responsibilities (Security **OF** the Cloud ) 
AWS is responsible for protecting the underlying infrastructure that runs AWS services.

### AWS typically handles:
- **Physical security:** data centers, buildings, access controls, surveillance
- **Hardware and infrastructure:** servers, storage, networking equipment
- **Virtualization layer:** host OS/hypervisor for many services
- **Core networking:** and foundational services that support the platform

_If it’s about data centers, hardware, or the base cloud infrastructure, it’s almost always **AWS**._


## 2) 🧑‍💻 Customer Responsibilities (Security **IN** the Cloud) 
Customers are responsible for what they deploy and configure on AWS, including controlling access and protecting their data.

### Customers typically handle:
- **Identity and access management (IAM):** users, roles, policies, MFA
- **Data protection:** encryption choices, key management decisions, data classification
- **Network configuration:** security groups, NACLs, VPC configuration
- **OS and application management:** patching, hardening _when applicable_
- **Customer data:** what you store, how you store it, who can access it
- **Logging and monitoring configuration:** what you enable tracking and alerts on

_If it’s about permissions, misconfiguration, data exposure, or application security, it’s usually **customer**._


## 3) 🤝 Shared Responsibilities (Depends on Context) 
Some areas are shared because both AWS and the customer play a role.

Common shared areas:
- **Configuration management:** AWS provides secure tools, _customers must configure them correctly._
- **Patch management:** AWS patches infrastructure, _customers patch OS/apps when they manage them._
- **Awareness and training:** AWS provides documentation, _customers ensure staff follow best practices._
- **Incident response:** AWS secures the platform, _customers respond to events in their accounts/workloads._
- **Compliance:** AWS provides compliant infrastructure, _customers must architect and operate compliantly._

_If “AWS provides the capability, customer must enable/configure it,” that’s usually **shared**._


## 4) 🔄 How Responsibilities Shift by Service Type 
Your responsibility changes based on whether you’re using **IaaS**, **PaaS**, or **serverless/managed** services.

### A. Amazon EC2 
EC2 is closer to “you run a server,” so you manage more.

**AWS handles:** physical facilities, hardware, underlying infrastructure  
**Customer handles:** guest OS patching, software installs, configuration, application security, data, IAM, network controls

_With EC2, you are responsible for the **operating system and above**._

---

### B. Amazon RDS
RDS is a managed database service so AWS takes over more operational tasks.

**AWS handles:** database engine patching/maintenance (service-dependent), backups features, underlying infrastructure  
**Customer handles:** database access controls, network exposure, encryption settings, parameter choices, data, IAM

_You don’t manage the database host like you would on EC2, but you still control **data security and access**._


### C. AWS Lambda 
Lambda is serverless so no servers to manage.

**AWS handles:** servers, OS, runtime infrastructure, scaling, availability of the service  
**Customer handles:** function code, IAM permissions, secrets management, event/input validation, data protection

_You focus on **code + permissions + data**, while AWS runs the platform._

---

### Quick Comparison
- **EC2:** customer manages **OS + patching + runtime + app**
- **RDS:** AWS manages **database platform**, customer manages **data + access + configuration**
- **Lambda:** AWS manages **servers/OS/scaling**, customer manages **code + IAM + data**



## ✅ Quick Exam-Style Summary 
- AWS Shared Responsibility Model:
  - **AWS = security OF the cloud**
  - **Customer = security IN the cloud**
- Responsibilities shift by service:
  - more managed/serverless = **more AWS responsibility**
  - more infrastructure control (like EC2) = **more customer responsibility**
