# Identify AWS Access Management Capabilities

🔑**Exam Guide:** Cloud Practitioner
**Domain 2: Security & Compliance**
📘_Task Statement 2.3_


## 🎯 What Is This Task Testing? 
This objective checks whether you understand how AWS manages identities and permissions, including:
- **IAM basics** (users, groups, roles, policies)
- Why and how to protect the **root user**
- The **principle of least privilege**
- **IAM Identity Center (AWS Single Sign-On)** and federated access
- Credentials: **access keys**, password policies, and secure storage (Secrets Manager / Systems Manager)



## 1) 🧠 IAM Basics
## Who You Are vs What You Can Do 
In AWS:
- An **identity** (user/role) answers: *“Who is making the request?”*
- A **policy** answers: *“What are they allowed to do?”*

### Core IAM components
- **IAM Users**: individual identities (often for people).
- **IAM Groups**: collections of users with shared permissions.
- **IAM Roles**: identities assumed temporarily (recommended for AWS services, cross-account access, and federation).
- **IAM Policies**: permission documents (JSON) that allow/deny actions on resources.

_Prefer **roles + temporary credentials** over long-lived credentials whenever possible._



## 2) 🛡️ Principle of Least Privilege 
**Least privilege** means granting only the permissions required to perform a task—nothing more.

- Use **narrow permissions** (specific actions + specific resources)
- Avoid using `"*"` for actions/resources unless required
- Assign permissions to **groups/roles**, not directly to many users (easier governance)
- Use **managed policies** where appropriate, but prefer **custom policies** when you need tighter control



## 3) 📄 Policies
### Managed vs Custom 
#### AWS Managed Policies
- Created and maintained by AWS
- Useful for common job roles and quick starts
- Might be broader than necessary

#### Customer Managed Policies (Custom)
- Created and maintained by you
- Best when you must enforce strict least privilege
- Reusable across users/roles/accounts

#### Inline Policies
- Attached to a single user/group/role
- Harder to manage at scale (use with care)


## 4) ✅ Authentication Methods in AWS 
You should recognize common ways users and systems authenticate:

- **Username/password:** IAM user sign-in to AWS console
- **Access keys:** programmatic access via CLI/SDK, should be protected and rotated
- **Multi-factor authentication (MFA):** strongly recommended, especially for privileged users
- **IAM Identity Center (AWS SSO):** centralized workforce access, typically backed by an identity provider
- **Cross-account IAM roles:** secure access across AWS accounts without sharing long-term credentials
- **Federated access:** external identity provider signs users in; AWS issues temporary credentials



## 5) 🏢 IAM Identity Center 
### AWS Single Sign-On
**IAM Identity Center** provides centralized access management for workforce users:
- One place to assign access to **AWS accounts** and applications
- Supports **SSO** and typically integrates with external identity providers (federation)
- Helps reduce the need for many separate IAM users in each account


## 6) Access Keys, Password Policies, and Credential Storage 🔐
### Access keys
- Used for programmatic access (CLI/SDK)
- Should be treated like passwords (never hard-code in code repositories)
- Best practice is to prefer **roles and temporary credentials** when possible

### Password policies (for IAM users)
Password policies can enforce:
- minimum length
- complexity requirements
- rotation/expiration
- preventing password reuse

### Credential storage (don’t store secrets in code)
- **AWS Secrets Manager**: purpose-built for managing secrets (credentials, API keys) and can support rotation workflows.
- **AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store**: stores configuration and secrets (often used for parameters; can store secure strings).

“Where should we store database passwords securely?” → **Secrets Manager** 
_Parameter Store is also valid in many scenarios depending on wording._



## 7) ⚠️ Root User
### Why It Matters and What Only Root Can Do 
The **root user** has full, unrestricted access to the account. It should be used only for tasks that require it.

### Tasks that commonly require the root user
- Changing the **account’s email address** or certain account settings
- Managing **root-level security settings** (e.g., some billing/ownership functions)
- Closing the AWS account
- Certain billing and payment configuration actions

_root is for rare, account-level administrative tasks._



## 8) 🛡️ Root User Protection Methods 
You should know best practices for protecting root:

- **Enable MFA on the root user**
- **Do not use root for daily administration**
- Create admin access for humans via **IAM users/roles** or **IAM Identity Center**
- Secure root credentials:
  - strong password
  - store credentials securely
- Use monitoring and detection (e.g., alerts on root activity) if mentioned

“How do you best protect the root account?” → **Enable MFA and avoid routine use**.



## 9) 🔄 Federated Identity
### Very common in enterprises
Users authenticate with an external identity provider (IdP), then receive access to AWS—often via:
- **IAM Identity Center**
- **assumed roles** (temporary credentials)

**Why it matters:** Federation reduces password sprawl and avoids creating lots of IAM users for employees.



## Quick Exam-Style Summary ✅
- **IAM** controls access using identities (users/groups/roles) + **policies**.
- Apply **least privilege**: only required actions, only required resources.
- **Roles + temporary credentials** are preferred over long-lived access keys.
- **IAM Identity Center (SSO)** supports centralized, federated workforce access.
- Store secrets in **AWS Secrets Manager** (or Parameter Store when appropriate), not in code.
- **Root user** is powerful and should be protected with **MFA** and used only when necessary.
