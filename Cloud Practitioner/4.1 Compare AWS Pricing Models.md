# Compare AWS Pricing Models
💸**Exam Guide:** Cloud Practitioner
**Domain 4: Billing, Pricing, and Support**
📘_Task Statement 4.1_

Domain 4 is the “money money money” part of Cloud Practitioner: not glamorous, but absolutely testable—and very real in the workplace. 

Can you pick the **most cost-effective** option *without breaking the workload requirements*? 

## 🎯 What Is This Task Testing?

You must be able to compare AWS pricing across:
- **Compute Purchasing Options** (On-Demand, Reserved Instances, Spot, Savings Plans, Dedicated Hosts/Instances, Capacity Reservations)
- **Data Transfer Charges** (inbound vs outbound, same Region vs cross-Region)
- **Storage Pricing Options and Tiers** (especially Amazon S3 classes)


## 1) 🖥️ Compute Purchasing Options  

### On-Demand Instances
Pay for compute capacity by the hour/second (service-dependent), with no long-term commitment.

**Use On Demand Instances When:**
- workloads are short-term, spiky, or unpredictable
- you’re developing/testing
- you can’t commit to steady usage yet

_“no commitment,” “unpredictable,” “temporary”_ → **On-Demand**.


### Reserved Instances (RIs)
Commit to a term (commonly 1 or 3 years) for discounted pricing on eligible services (frequently associated with EC2, and also used in other contexts like RDS).

**Use Reserved Instances When:**
- workload is steady and predictable
- you want a discount in exchange for commitment

_“steady usage,” “known baseline,” “commit for lower cost”_ → **Reserved Instances**.

#### Reserved Instance flexibility
RIs can offer flexibility depending on the RI type and scope. At the exam level, know:
- Some RIs can apply across **different instance sizes within an instance family** (size flexibility), depending on configuration.
- The more specific the reservation, the less flexible it is, but it can better match a known workload.

_“need flexibility as instance sizes change”_ → think **RI flexibility** (or Savings Plans).

#### Reserved Instances in AWS Organizations
In an AWS Organizations setup, RI benefits can be shared across accounts (within the organization) depending on configuration.

_“multiple accounts under one org want to share discounts”_ → **RIs in AWS Organizations**.


### Savings Plans
A flexible pricing model where you commit to a consistent amount of compute usage (measured as $/hour) over 1 or 3 years.

**Use Savings Plans When:**
- you want RI-like savings but with **more flexibility**
- you have steady compute spend, even if instance types may change

_“commit to spend, want flexibility across compute”_ → **Savings Plans**.

### Spot Instances
Purchase unused EC2 capacity at deep discounts, but AWS can reclaim the capacity with short notice.

**Use Spot Instances When:**
- workloads are fault-tolerant and can handle interruptions
- batch processing, big data jobs, CI/testing, containerized stateless workloads

_“can be interrupted,” “batch/fault-tolerant,” “lowest cost compute”_ → **Spot**.


### Dedicated Instances
EC2 instances that run on hardware dedicated to a single customer, but the hardware is still managed by AWS and may be shared across instances within your account.

**Use Dedicated Instances When:**
- you need single-tenant hardware for compliance or licensing reasons

_“single-tenant instances”_ → **Dedicated Instances**.


### Dedicated Hosts
A physical server dedicated to you, giving you more visibility and control over how instances are placed on that server (commonly used for licensing requirements).

**Use Dedicated Hosts When:**
- you need to use certain **bring-your-own-license (BYOL)** models that require dedicated physical hardware
- you need control at the host level

_“BYOL requires dedicated server/host”_ → **Dedicated Hosts**.


### Capacity Reservations
Reserve capacity in a specific AZ for EC2, ensuring it’s available when you need it.

**Use Capacity Reservations When:**
- you must guarantee capacity (regulatory, business-critical events, predictable spikes)
- you need capacity in a particular Availability Zone

_“must have capacity available in this AZ”_ → **Capacity Reservations**.


## 2) 🌐 Data Transfer Charges 
Data transfer pricing is a frequent exam topic because it surprises people in real life.

### Inbound vs Outbound
- **Inbound data transfer (into AWS)** is often **lower cost or free**, depending on the service and scenario.
- **Outbound data transfer (out of AWS)** is more commonly **charged**.

_“moving data from one Region to another”_ →  **data transfer charges apply**.  
_“sending data out to end users on the internet”_ → **outbound/egress costs**.


## 3) 🗂️ Storage Options and Tiers 
Storage pricing depends mainly on:
- how frequently you access data
- how quickly you need retrieval
- durability/resiliency design (e.g., multi-AZ vs single-AZ)
- storage amount, requests, and retrieval charges (service-dependent)

### Amazon S3 storage classes 
- **S3 Standard**: frequent access
- **S3 Intelligent-Tiering**: unknown/changing access patterns
- **S3 Standard-IA / One Zone-IA**: infrequent access (One Zone = lower cost, single AZ)
- **S3 Glacier tiers**: archival storage (lowest cost, slower retrieval options)

_“archive for years, rarely accessed”_ → **Glacier / Deep Archive**.  
_“unknown access pattern”_ → **Intelligent-Tiering**.  
_“cheaper storage but still quickly accessible”_ → **Standard-IA** (or similar).


## ✅ Quick Exam-Style Summary
- **On-Demand**: short-term, unpredictable, no commitment
- **Reserved Instances**: steady workloads, commit for discount (some flexibility, can share in AWS Organizations)
- **Savings Plans**: commit to compute spend with flexibility
- **Spot**: biggest discounts, interruption-tolerant workloads
- **Dedicated Instances/Hosts**: single-tenant needs (Hosts have most control for licensing)
- **Capacity Reservations**: guarantee capacity in a specific AZ
- **Data transfer**: inbound often cheaper, outbound/cross-Region commonly costs more
- **Storage tiers**: pay less for infrequent/archive, trade off access speed and sometimes resiliency
