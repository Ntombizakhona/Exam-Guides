# Identify Components and Resources for Security

🛡️**Exam Guide:** Cloud Practitioner
**Domain 2: Security & Compliance**
📘_Task Statement 2.4_



##  🎯What Is This Task Testing?
You need to recognize:
- Core **AWS security capabilities** (network controls, threat detection, DDoS protection, web protection)
- Where to find **AWS security documentation and guidance**
- That **third-party security tools** exist via **AWS Marketplace**
- Which AWS services can help **identify security issues** (for example, Trusted Advisor)


## 1) 🔐 AWS Security Features and Services to Know 
_“Which service/control should you use?”_ Know the purpose of each.

### Security Groups (SGs)
- A **virtual firewall** for resources such as Amazon EC2.
- Control **inbound and outbound** traffic.
- Generally **stateful** (return traffic is automatically allowed).

**Use SGs When:** _you need instance/resource-level traffic control (ports, protocols, source/destination)._


### Network ACLs (NACLs)
- A firewall at the **subnet** level in a VPC.
- Control **inbound and outbound** rules for subnets.
- Generally **stateless** (return traffic must be explicitly allowed).

**Use NACLs When:** _you need subnet-wide allow/deny rules, including explicit denies._


### AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- A **web application firewall** that helps protect web apps from common exploits.
- Filters/monitors **HTTP(S)** requests (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting).

**Use WAF When:** _you want to block malicious web requests or enforce web rules at the edge/front door._


### AWS Firewall Manager
- A **central management** service for security rules and policies.
- Helps you configure and manage protections (for example, WAF rules) **across multiple accounts and resources**, commonly in AWS Organizations environments.

**Use Firewall Manager When:** _you need consistent security policy enforcement at scale across many accounts._



### AWS Shield
- Helps protect against **DDoS attacks**.
- Commonly positioned for protecting internet-facing applications.

**Use Shield when:** _the scenario mentions DDoS attacks, volumetric attacks, or keeping public endpoints available during attacks._


### Amazon GuardDuty
- A **threat detection** service that monitors for suspicious activity and unauthorized behavior.
- Uses signals such as account activity and network/DNS patterns to generate findings.

**Use GuardDuty when:** _you need continuous threat detection and alerts for potentially compromised resources or accounts._



## 2)  🧩 Third-Party Security Products 
### AWS Marketplace
AWS also supports third-party security tooling for needs like:
- SIEM/log analytics
- endpoint protection
- vulnerability scanning
- network security appliances

**AWS Marketplace** is where you can find and deploy **third-party security products** that integrate with AWS.

_“Where can you obtain third-party security solutions for AWS?” → **AWS Marketplace**._


## 3) 📚 Where to Find AWS Security Information 
Know where AWS publishes official guidance, updates, and troubleshooting:

- **AWS Security Center**: centralized security guidance and best practices.
- **AWS Security Blog**: announcements and deep dives on AWS security topics.
- **AWS Knowledge Center**: how-to articles and troubleshooting steps.


_“official guidance/best practices”_ → *Security Center*  
_“latest updates and detailed posts”_ → *Security Blog*  
_“how do I fix/configure X?”_ → *Knowledge Center*  


## 4) Using AWS Services to Identify Security Issues 🔎
### AWS Trusted Advisor
Trusted Advisor scans your environment and provides best-practice recommendations across multiple categories, including **Security**.

**Use Trusted Advisor When:** you want recommendations that flag common security risks and misconfigurations (_along with other best-practice areas_).



## ✅ Quick Exam-Style Summary 
- **Security groups:**  instance-level firewall (_stateful_).
- **NACLs:** subnet-level firewall (_stateless_).
- **AWS WAF:** web request filtering/protection.
- **AWS Firewall Manager:** centralized policy management across accounts/resources.
- **AWS Shield:** DDoS protection.
- **Amazon GuardDuty:**threat detection findings.
- **AWS Marketplace:** third-party security products.
- Security info sources: **AWS Security Center**, **AWS Security Blog**, **AWS Knowledge Center**.
- **AWS Trusted Advisor:**  identifies security issues via best-practice checks
