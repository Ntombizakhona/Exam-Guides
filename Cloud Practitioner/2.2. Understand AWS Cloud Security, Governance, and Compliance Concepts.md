# Understand AWS Cloud Security, Governance, and Compliance Concepts

🛡️**Exam Guide:** Cloud Practitioner
**Domain 2: Security & Compliance**
📘_Task Statement 2.2_


## 🎯What Is This Task Testing?
You need to understand how AWS and customers address:
- **Compliance & governance** concepts (where to find compliance info, how requirements vary)
- **Cloud security benefits** (especially encryption)
- **Security logging** (where logs are captured and stored)
- Key **security, governance, and compliance services** and what they do


## 1) 🏛️ AWS Compliance & Governance Concepts 
**Governance:** policies, controls, and oversight to ensure AWS use aligns with business goals and risk tolerance.
  
**Compliance:** meeting legal/regulatory/industry requirements (e.g., POPIA, HIPAA, PCI DSS, GDPR).

_AWS provides a compliant cloud foundation, but **you must configure and use services in a compliant way** ([shared responsibility](https://dev.to/aws-builders/understand-the-aws-shared-responsibility-model-4o9c))._



## 2) 🗂️ Where to Find AWS Compliance Information
### AWS Artifact
**AWS Artifact** is the go-to place for **on-demand compliance reports and agreements**, such as:
- SOC reports
- ISO reports
- other audit documentation

_“Where do you download AWS compliance reports?” → **AWS Artifact**._ 


### AWS Compliance
For understanding **which programs AWS supports** and general compliance guidance (across Regions/industries), use **AWS Compliance** resources.

_“Where do you learn about AWS compliance programs by industry/region?” → **AWS Compliance**._



## 3) 🌍 Compliance Needs Vary by Geography and Industry 
Compliance requirements commonly differ by:
- **country/region data laws:** data residency, privacy rules
- **industry regulations:** healthcare, finance, government
- **service eligibility:** not every AWS service is approved/eligible for every framework

_Some frameworks require controls like **encryption**, **logging**, **retention**, and **access auditing**._

_Some programs (e.g., HIPAA) have **eligible services lists**, so compliance can depend on *which AWS services you choose*._



## 4) 🔐 How Customers Secure Resources on AWS 
Know the purpose of these services:

- **Amazon GuardDuty**: threat detection using signals like CloudTrail events, VPC Flow Logs, and DNS logs.
- **AWS Security Hub**: central “security posture” view; aggregates findings from multiple AWS services/tools.
- **Amazon Inspector**: automated vulnerability management _(e.g., scanning for software vulnerabilities and exposure on supported resources)._
- **AWS Shield**: DDoS protection _(especially relevant for internet-facing apps)._



## 5) 🔒 Encryption  
### Encryption in transit
Protects data **while moving** across networks.
- Typically uses TLS/HTTPS
- Keywords: “client-to-server encryption,” “secure communication channel”

### Encryption at rest
Protects **stored data** (e.g., on disks, in databases, in object storage).
- Often integrated with AWS services and key management options
- Keywords: “stored data encryption,” “disk/database/object encryption”

_If the question or scenario says “protect data moving between client and AWS,” choose **encryption in transit**. If it says “stored in S3/EBS/database,” choose **encryption at rest**._



## 6) 🧾 Where to Capture and Locate Security Logs 
Security and compliance rely heavily on logging. Know *what each log type records* and *where it typically ends up*.

### Core logging services and locations
- **AWS CloudTrail**: records account activity and API calls _(who did what, when, from where)_.
  - Can be delivered to **Amazon S3** _(long-term storage)_ and/or **CloudWatch Logs** _(alerting/near-real-time monitoring)._
- **Amazon CloudWatch**: operational monitoring _(metrics, alarms)_ and **CloudWatch Logs** for centralized log storage/analysis.
- **AWS Config**: records resource configuration changes and evaluates configuration against rules _(useful for compliance drift)._
- Other Common Logs
  - **VPC Flow Logs**: network flow metadata _(accepted/rejected traffic)_ sent to CloudWatch Logs or S3.
  - **Load balancer access logs / S3 access logs**: service-level access logging stored in S3.

_“Audit API activity”_ → **CloudTrail.**  
_“Monitor and alert on logs/metrics”_ → **CloudWatch.**  
_“Track configuration history and drift”_ → **AWS Config.**



## 7) 🧩 Governance and Compliance Services 
Recognize which tools align to monitoring, auditing, and reporting:

- **Monitoring:** Amazon CloudWatch
- **Auditing:** AWS CloudTrail, **AWS Config**, **AWS Audit Manager**
- **Reporting / access reports:** common IAM reporting tools such as **IAM credential reports** and access-related reports (used to review access and support governance)

### AWS Audit Manager
Helps **continuously gather evidence** and map it to common compliance frameworks, reducing manual audit effort.



## ✅ Quick Exam-Style Summary 
- **AWS Artifact:**  download compliance reports and agreements.
- **AWS Compliance resources:** learn about programs by industry/region.
- **Encryption:** in transit _(TLS)_ vs at rest _(stored data)._
- **Logging:** CloudTrail _(API audit)_ + CloudWatch _(monitor/alerts/logs)_ + Config _(configuration history/compliance drift)._
- **Security services:** GuardDuty _(threat detection), Inspector (vuln management), Security Hub (posture + findings aggregation), Shield (DDoS protection).
- Compliance can vary by **Region**, **industry**, and **service eligibility**.
