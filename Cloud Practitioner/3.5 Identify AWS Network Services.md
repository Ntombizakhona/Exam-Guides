# Identify AWS Network Services
🌐**Exam Guide:** Cloud Practitioner
**Domain 3: Cloud Technology & Services**
📘_Task Statement 3.5_

## 🎯 What Is This Task Testing?
- **Amazon VPC** components (Subnets, Gateways, Routing)
- VPC security controls (**Security Groups** and **Network ACLs**)
- The purpose of **Amazon Route 53**
- Edge networking services (**Amazon CloudFront**, **AWS Global Accelerator**)
- Connectivity options to AWS (**AWS Site-to-Site VPN**, **AWS Direct Connect**)


## 1) 🧱 Amazon VPC
### The Foundation of AWS Networking 
An **Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** is a logically isolated network in AWS where you launch resources.

### Key VPC components to recognize
- **Subnets**
  - A subnet is a range of IP addresses within a VPC.
  - Subnets Are Often Described As:
    - **Public Subnet**: has a route to the internet (_typically through an internet gateway_)
    - **Private Subnet**: no direct route to the internet

- **Route Tables:** Determine where network traffic is directed (_e.g., to the internet, to a VPN, to another subnet_).

- **Gateways**
  - **Internet Gateway (IGW)**: enables internet connectivity for resources in public subnets.
  - **NAT Gateway**: allows resources in *private* subnets to access the internet **outbound** for updates and downloads while preventing inbound internet-initiated connections.

_“private subnet needs outbound internet access but should not be publicly reachable”_ → **NAT Gateway**.


## 2) 🔐 VPC Security
### Security Groups
- Firewall at the **resource or instance level** (commonly for EC2).
- Controls **inbound and outbound** rules.
- Generally **stateful** which means _return traffic is automatically allowed_.

**Use Security Groups When:** you need to control traffic to/from a specific instance or resource.

### Network ACLs (NACLs)
- Firewall at the **subnet level**.
- Controls **inbound and outbound** traffic for a subnet.
- Generally **stateless**  which means _return traffic must be explicitly allowed_.

**Use NACLs When:** you need subnet-wide rules, including explicit deny rules.


### Private access to Amazon Inspector using AWS PrivateLink (Interface Endpoints)
Although **Amazon Inspector** is a security service not a VPC firewall, it was mentioned in the [Exam Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pdfs/aws-certification/latest/examguides/aws-certification-exam-guides.pdf) so, we might as well touch upon it.
So you *can* connect to it privately from inside your VPC.

- With **AWS PrivateLink**, you can set up a **private connection** from your VPC to **Amazon Inspector** so traffic stays on the AWS network.
- This lets you reach Inspector **as if it were inside your VPC**, without needing an **internet gateway**, **NAT device**, **VPN**, or **Direct Connect**.
- Your instances can access Inspector **without public IP addresses**.

**How?**

1. You create an **interface VPC endpoint** (powered by PrivateLink).
2. AWS places **endpoint network interfaces** in each subnet you enable for that endpoint.
3. Those endpoint network interfaces act as the **entry point** for traffic going from your VPC to Amazon Inspector.


## 3) 🧭 Amazon Route53 
### Domain Name System
**Amazon Route53** is AWS’s **Domain Name System (DNS)** service.

**Purpose of Amazon Route53:**
- translates domain names (like `example.com`) into IP addresses
- routes end users to applications (often by directing them to load balancers or endpoints)
- supports routing policies for controlling how traffic is directed.

_“DNS,” “domain registration,” “route users to endpoint”_ → **Route 53**.


## 4) ⚡Edge Services  
### Amazon CloudFront
Amazon CloudFront is a **content delivery network (CDN)** that caches and delivers content from locations close to users.

**Use Amazon CloudFront When:**
- you want faster delivery of websites, static assets, and streaming/media content
- you want reduced latency for global users


### AWS Global Accelerator
AWS Global Accelerator improves performance by routing traffic onto the AWS global network and directing users to the optimal endpoint.

**Use AWS Global Accelerator When:**
- you want improved global performance and availability for internet-facing applications
- you want intelligent routing to the best performing regional endpoint

**CloudFront:** _caching/content delivery_
**Global Accelerator:** _network traffic acceleration and routing to endpoints_


## 5) 🔌 Network Connectivity Options to AWS 
### AWS Site-to-Site VPN
AWS Site-to-Site VPN creates an encrypted **VPN tunnel** over the public internet between your on-premises network and AWS.

**Use AWS Site-to-Site VPN When:**
- you need a relatively quick connectivity option
- you can tolerate internet-based variability
- encryption over the public internet is acceptable


### AWS Direct Connect
AWS Direct Connect is a dedicated, private network connection between your on-premises environment and AWS.

**Use AWS Direct Connect When:**
- you need more consistent network performance
- you want private connectivity (not traversing the public internet)
- you have higher bandwidth requirements or steady traffic patterns

_“dedicated connection,” “consistent latency,” “private link to AWS”_ → **Direct Connect**.


## ✅ Quick Exam-Style Summary 
- **VPC** contains subnets, route tables, and gateways.
- **Internet Gateway** enables internet access for public subnets
- **NAT Gateway** enables outbound internet for private subnets.
- **Security groups** (resource or instance-level, stateful) vs **NACLs** (subnet-level, stateless).
- **PrivateLink/interface endpoints** can provide private access to AWS services (example: Amazon Inspector) without public IPs or internet-based connectivity.
- **Route 53:** DNS and traffic routing to endpoints.
- **CloudFront:** CDN caching near users
- **Global Accelerator:**  improved global routing to endpoints.
- Connectivity: **VPN** (encrypted over internet) vs **Direct Connect** (dedicated private connection).
