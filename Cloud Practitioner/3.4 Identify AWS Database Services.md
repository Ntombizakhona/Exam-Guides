# Identify AWS Database Services

🗄️**Exam Guide:** Cloud Practitioner
**Domain 3: Cloud Technology & Services**
📘*Task Statement 3.4*

## 🎯 What Is This Task Testing?

You must recognize AWS database options and match them to scenarios:
- When to use **Databases on EC2** vs **Managed Databases**
- Identify **Relational** services (Amazon RDS, Amazon Aurora)
- Identify **NoSQL** services (Amazon DynamoDB)
- Identify **Memory-Based** services (Amazon ElastiCache)
- Know **Database Migration Tools** (AWS DMS, AWS SCT)


## 1) 🧠 EC2-Hosted Databases vs Managed Databases 
A common decision to make is whether you should run a database yourself on Amazon EC2 or use a managed database service.

### Self Managed Databases on Amazon EC2
You install and manage the database software on EC2.

**You Manage:**
- OS and database patching
- backups and restores
- high availability setup
- scaling and maintenance tasks

**Use Self Managed Databases on Amazon EC2 When:**
- you need full control over the OS/database configuration
- you must use a database engine/configuration not supported by managed services
- you have special compliance or tooling requirements that require self-management


### AWS Managed Databases 
AWS handles many operational tasks.

**Benefits When AWS Operates The Platform:**
- reduced administrative overhead (_patching, backups, maintenance_)
- built-in high availability options
- easier scaling and monitoring
- faster time-to-value

**Use AWS Managed Databases When:**
- you want to offload routine database administration
- you want built-in reliability features without building everything yourself



## 2) 🧾Relational Databases 
### SQL
Relational databases are used when you need structured data, SQL queries, joins, and strong consistency/transaction support.

### Amazon RDS
A managed service for relational databases and supports multiple engines.

**Use Amazon RDS When:**
- you want a managed relational database with common engines
- you need standard SQL database capabilities with simplified operations

 _“managed SQL database”_ → **Amazon RDS**.


### Amazon Aurora
A relational database purpose built for the cloud and compatible with common SQL engines.

**Use Amazon Aurora When:**
- you want higher performance and cloud-optimized relational database features
- you want a managed relational database designed for scalability and availability

_“cloud-optimized relational,” “high performance relational”_ → **Amazon Aurora**.


## 3) 🧩 NoSQL Databases 
### Amazon DynamoDB
A managed NoSQL database service designed for very fast, scalable access patterns.

**Use Amazon DynamoDB When:**
- you need low-latency reads/writes at scale
- your data model is key-value or document-style
- you want a fully managed NoSQL service without server management

_“serverless NoSQL,” “key-value,” “massive scale with low latency”_ → **DynamoDB**.


## 4) ⚡ Memory-Based Databases 
### 
A managed in-memory data store commonly used for caching.

**Use Amazon ElastiCache When:**
- you need caching to reduce database load
- you need very fast access for frequently requested data
- you need in-memory storage for performance-sensitive workloads (_like session storage, leaderboards, or caching query results_)

_“in-memory,” “cache,” “speed up reads”_ → **ElastiCache**.


## 5) 🚚 Database Migration Tools 
Can you identify the right tool for moving Databases to AWS?

### AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS)
AWS DMS is a service designed to move data between databases and it helps migrate databases to AWS with minimal downtime.

**Use AWS DMS When:**
- you need to migrate data from one database to another
- you want to reduce downtime during migration (continuous replication can be part of the approach)

_“migrate with minimal downtime,” “replicate database to AWS”_ → **AWS DMS**.


### AWS Schema Conversion Tool (AWS SCT)
AWS SCT helps convert database schemas and code when moving between database engines especially from commercial/legacy engines to AWS-supported targets.

**Use AWS SCT When:**
- the source and target database engines differ and require schema/code conversion
- you need help converting tables, indexes, stored procedures, etc.

_“convert schema,” “move from one engine to another”_ → **AWS SCT**.


## ✅ Quick Exam-Style Summary 
- **EC2-hosted DB**: maximum control, maximum operational responsibility.
- **Managed DB**: AWS reduces ops overhead (_patching, backups, HA features_).
- **Relational (SQL)**: **Amazon RDS**, **Amazon Aurora**.
- **NoSQL**: **Amazon DynamoDB**.
- **In-memory/caching**: **Amazon ElastiCache**.
- **Migration**:
  - **AWS DMS:** migrate/replicate data (often minimal downtime)
  - **AWS SCT:** convert schema/code across engines
