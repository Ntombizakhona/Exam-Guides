🧑‍💻**Exam Guide:** Cloud Practitioner
**Domain 4: Billing, Pricing, and Support**
📘_Task Statement 4.3_

## 🎯 What Is This Task Testing?

You need to know where to get help on AWS and which support/assistance option fits a scenario:
- Official AWS **Documentation**, Whitepapers, and Blogs
- Key Technical Resources: **AWS Prescriptive Guidance**, **AWS Knowledge Center**, **AWS re:Post**
- **AWS Support Plans** and where support cases are managed (**AWS Support Center**)
- Tools that help monitor/manage environments: **Trusted Advisor**, **AWS Health Dashboard**, **AWS Health API**
- The **AWS Trust and Safety** team for reporting abuse
- The role and benefits of **AWS Partners** (APN), including **AWS Marketplace**, ISVs, and system integrators
- Other assistance: **AWS Professional Services**, **AWS Solutions Architects**


## 1) 📚 Official AWS Technical Resources 

### AWS Documentation
The primary source for service details, tutorials, and reference guides.

**Use AWS Documentation When:** you need the official _“how it works”_ and _“how to configure it”_ for a service.



### AWS Whitepapers
Architectural guidance and best practices, often referenced in exam preparation guides. 

**Use AWS White Papers When:** you need design guidance (security, reliability, well-architected approaches).

_I know you didn't ask, but AWS Whitepapers are my favourite source of information, and I try to read at least one per day._



### AWS Blogs
Updates, announcements, and deep dives into implementation patterns.

**Use AWS Blogs When:** you need practical examples, new feature information, or service walkthroughs.



## 2) 🧭 Targeted Help Resources 
### AWS Prescriptive Guidance
Curated guidance, patterns, and step-by-step recommendations for building and migrating on AWS.

**Use AWS Prescriptive Guidance When:** you want recommended approaches for migrations, modernization, and architecture patterns.



### AWS Knowledge Center
AWS-authored troubleshooting and “how-to” articles, very practical.

**Use AWS Knowledge Center When:** you need to fix common configuration issues or follow step-by-step troubleshooting.



### AWS re:Post
A community Q&A resource for AWS technical questions.

**Use AWS re:Post When:** you want community answers, discussion, and shared solutions.



## 3) 🧾 AWS Support Center
The **AWS Support Center** is where customers typically:
- open and manage support cases
- view case history and communication
- access support-related tools tied to their plan

_“open a support case”_ → **AWS Support Center**.



## 4) 🛠️ AWS Support Plans
You should recognize these support options:

- **Customer service & communities**
  - Self-service resources + forums/community help
  - Good for general questions and learning

- **AWS Developer Support**
  - For developers building/testing on AWS who need technical guidance

- **AWS Business Support**
  - For production workloads needing stronger support response and guidance

- **AWS Enterprise On-Ramp Support**
  - For customers moving into broader enterprise support needs (a step toward full enterprise)

- **AWS Enterprise Support**
  - For mission-critical, large-scale production environments needing the highest level of support


_“small dev team needs guidance” _→ **Developer Support**
_“production system needs faster, more robust support”_ → **Business Support**
_“mission critical / enterprise-wide operations”_ → **Enterprise Support** (or **Enterprise On-Ramp** if phrased as ramping up)



## 5) 🔍 Tools That Help Manage Environments

### AWS Trusted Advisor
Provides best-practice recommendations across categories including **cost optimization** and **security**.

**Use AWS Trusted Advisor When:** you want checks that identify cost-saving opportunities or common misconfigurations.


### AWS Health Dashboard
Shows service health and events that may affect AWS resources.

**Use AWS Health Dashboard When:** you need awareness of outages, degradation, or maintenance events.


### AWS Health API
Programmatic access to AWS Health information.

**Use AWS Health API When:** you want to integrate health events into monitoring/automation or internal dashboards.


_“recommendations for cost optimization”_ → **Trusted Advisor**
_“check AWS service incidents affecting me”_ → **Health Dashboard**
_“pull health events into my tooling”_ → **Health API**


## 6) ⚠️ Reporting Abuse: AWS Trust and Safety 
The **AWS Trust and Safety team** handles reports of abuse of AWS resources.

**Use AWS Trust and Safety When:** you need to report things like:
- malicious activity hosted on AWS
- spam/phishing activity
- abusive or illegal content distribution using AWS infrastructure

_“report abuse”_ → **AWS Trust and Safety**.


## 7) 🤝 AWS Partners and AWS Marketplace 
### AWS Partner Network (APN) roles
- **Independent Software Vendors (ISVs):** build and sell software solutions that run on or integrate with AWS.
- **System Integrators (SIs):** help customers design, migrate, and operate workloads on AWS (implementation and consulting).


_“need a partner to migrate and implement”_ → **System Integrator**
_“need a packaged third-party product”_ → **ISV** (often via Marketplace)


### Benefits of being an AWS Partner 
- partner training and certification opportunities
- partner events and enablement
- potential partner discounts/volume-related benefits (as described in AWS partner programs)


### AWS Marketplace 
AWS Marketplace is a digital catalog for third-party solutions, including categories such as:
- security, networking, databases
- **cost management**
- **governance and entitlement** (managing access/usage of purchased products)

_“buy third-party solutions that integrate with AWS”_ → **AWS Marketplace**.



## 8) 🧑‍🔧 Other Technical Assistance Options 
### AWS Professional Services
AWS experts who can help plan and execute migrations, modernizations, and large projects.

**Use AWS Professional Services When:** you want hands-on help delivering a major AWS initiative.


### AWS Solutions Architects
AWS technical experts who help customers design solutions (often via guidance and best practices, especially for architecture decisions).

**Use AWS Solutions Architects When:** you need architectural guidance on selecting services and designing on AWS.
